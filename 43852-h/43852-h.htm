am not ignorant
of the
Censure I lay
my-self open
to, in offering so incorrect
a Work to a Person
of Your Grace's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Judgment; and could not
have had Assurance to
do it, if I was unacquainted
with Your Grace's
Goodness. As this is
not the first time of this
Excellent Author's appearing
in <i>English</i>, my
Undertaking must expose
me to abundance
of Cavil and Criticism;
and I see my-self reduced
to the Necessity
of applying to a Patron
who is able to protect
me.</p>

<p>Our modern Dedications
are meer Daub
and Flattery; but 'tis
for those who deserve
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
no better: Your Grace
cannot be flatter'd; every
body that knows
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wharton</span>,
will say there is
no praising him, as
there is no loving him
more than he deserves.
But like other Great
Minds, Your Grace may
be blind to your own
Merit, and imagine I
am complimenting, or
doing something worse,
whilst I am only giving
your just Character;
for which reason, however
fond I am of so
noble a Theme, I shall
decline attempting it.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Only this I must beg
leave to say, Your Grace
can't be enough admir'd
for the Universal Learning
which you are Master
of, for your Judgment
in discerning, your
Indulgence in excusing,
for the great Stedfastness
of your Soul, for
your Contempt of Power
and Grandeur, your
Love for your Country,
your Passion for Liberty,
and (which is the
best Characteristick)
your Desire of doing
Good to Mankind. I
can hardly leave so agreeable
a Subject, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
I cannot say more than
all the World knows
already.</p>

<p>Your Grace's illustrious
Father has left a
Name behind Him as
glorious as any Person
of the Age: it is unnecessary
to enter into the
Particulars of his Character;
to mention his
Name, is the greatest
Panegyrick: Immediately
to succeed that
Great Man, must have
been extremely to the
Disadvantage of any other
Person, but it is
far from being so to
Your Grace; it makes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
your Virtues but the
more conspicuous, and
convinces us the Nation
is not without one Man
worthy of being his
Successor.</p>

<p>I have nothing more
to trouble Your Grace
with, than only to wish
you the Honours you
so well deserve, and to
beg you would excuse
my presuming to honour
my-self with the

<i>mongst the Historians of

more justly deserv'd, neither

only by this Piece, but also by the
<span class="antiqua">Revolutions of</span> Sweden <span class="antiqua">and of</span>
Rome, which he has since publish'd.</i></p>

<p><i>This small History he has extracted

several <span class="antiqua">French</span>, <span class="antiqua">Spanish</span>, <span class="antiqua">Portuguese</span>,

<i>many Persons, who were in <span class="antiqua">Lisbon</span>
at the time of the Revolution.
And I believe that it will
be no difficult matter to persuade
the Reader, that this little Volume
is written with much more
Politeness and Fidelity than any
which has been publish'd on this
Subject.</i></p>

<p><i>And indeed there could be no
Man fitter to undertake the Work
than Monsieur <span class="antiqua">de Vertot</span>; not only
as he was Master of an excellent
Style, and had all the Opportunities
imaginable of informing
himself of the Truth, but also as
he could have no Interest in speaking
partially of either the one or
the other Party; and therefore
might say much more justly than
<span class="antiqua">Salust, de Conjuratione, Quam

<p><i>Would I undertake to prove
the Impartiality of my Author, I
could easily do it from several little
Circumstances of his History.
Does he not tell us, that the Inquisition
is oftner a Terror to honest
Men than to Rogues? Does
he not paint the Archbishop of
<span class="antiqua">Braga</span> in all the Colours of a
Traitor? And I am fully persuaded,
that if a Churchman will
own and discover the Frailties, or
rather the Enormities of those of
his own Cloth, he will tell them
in any thing else, and is worthy
of being believed.</i></p>

<p><i>There are several Passages in
the following Sheets, which really
deserve our Attention; we shall
see a Nation involv'd in Woe and
Ruin, and all their Miseries proceeding
from the Bigotry and Superstition
of their Monarch, whose
Zeal hurries him to inevitable
Destruction, and whose Piety</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
<i>makes him sacrifice the Lives of
<span class="antiqua">13000</span> Christians, without so
much as having the Satisfaction
of converting one obstinate Infidel.</i></p>

<p><i>Such was the Fate of the rash
Don <span class="antiqua">Sebastian</span>, who seem'd born
to be the Blessing of his People,
and Terror of his Foes; who would
have made a just, a wise, a truly
pious Monarch, had not his Education
been entrusted to a Jesuit.
Nor is he the only unfortunate
Prince, who, govern'd
by intriguing and insinuating
Churchmen, have prov'd the Ruin
of their Kingdom, and in the end
lost both their Crown and Life.</i></p>

<p><i>We shall see a People, who, no
longer able to bear a heavy Yoke,
resolve to shake it off, and venture
their Lives and their Fortunes for
their Liberty: A Conspiracy prevail,
(if an Intent to revolt from
an Usurping Tyrant may be call'd
a Conspiracy) in which so many</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<i>Persons, whose Age, Quality and Interest
were very different, are engag'd;
and by the Courage and Publick Spirit
of a few, a happy and glorious Revolution
brought about.</i></p>

<p><i>But scarce is the new King settled
upon his Throne, and endeavouring
to confirm his Authority abroad, when
a horrid Conspiracy is forming against
him at home; we shall see a Prelate
at the head of the Traitors, who, tho
a bigotted Churchman, makes no scruple
of borrowing the Assistance of the
most profess'd Enemies of the Church
to deliver her out of Danger, and to
assassinate his Lawful King: but the
whole Plot is happily discover'd, and
those who were engaged in it meet
with the just Reward of Treason and
Rebellion, the Block and Gallows.
Nor is it the first time that our own
Nation has seen an Archbishop doing
King and Country all the harm he could.</i></p>

<p><i>After the Death of her Husband,
we see a Queen of an extraordinary</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
<i>Genius, and uncommon Courage, taking
the Regency upon her; and tho
at first oppress'd with a Load of
Misfortunes, rises against them all,
and in the end triumphs over her
Enemies.</i></p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Under the next Reign we see the
Kingdom almost invaded by the antient
Usurper, and sav'd only by the
Skill of a Wife and Brave General,
who had much ado to keep the Foes
out, whilst the People were divided at
home, and loudly complain'd of the
Riots and Debaucheries of their Monarch,
and the Tyrannick Conduct of
his Minister. But we find how impossible
a thing it is, that so violent
a Government should last long; his
Brother, a Prince whose Virtues were
as famous, as the other's Vices were
odious, to preserve the Crown in their
Family, is forced to depose him, and
take the Government upon himself:

ortugal is part of that vast
Tract of Land, known by the
Name of <i>Iberia</i> or <i>Spain</i>, most of
whose Provinces are call'd Kingdoms.
It is bounded on the
West by the Ocean, on the East by <i>Castile</i>.
Its Length is about a hundred and ten
Leagues, and its Breadth in the very broadest
part does not exceed fifty. The Soil is
fruitful, the Air wholesome; and tho under
such a Climate we might expect excessive
Heats, yet here we always find them allay'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
with cooling Breezes or refreshing Rains. Its
Crown is Hereditary, the King's Power Despotick,
nor is the grand Inquisition the
most useless means of preserving this absolute
Authority. The <i>Portuguese</i> are by Nature
proud and haughty, very zealous, but
rather superstitious than religious; the most
natural Events will amongst them pass for
Miracles, and they are firmly persuaded that
Heaven is always contriving something or
other for their Good.</p>

<p>Who the first Inhabitants of this Country
were, is not known, their own Historians
indeed tell us that they are sprung from
<i>Tubal</i>; for my part, I believe them descended
from the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Carthaginians</i>, who
long contended for those Provinces, and who
were both at sundry times in actual possession
of them. About the beginning of the fifth
Century, the <i>Swedes</i>, the <i>Vandals</i>, and all
those other barbarous Nations, generally
known by the Name of <i>Goths</i>, over-run the
Empire; and, amongst other Places, made
themselves Masters of the Provinces of <i>Spain</i>.
<i>Portugal</i> was then made a Kingdom, and was
sometimes govern'd by its own Prince, at
other times it was reckon'd part of the Dominions
of the King of <i>Castile</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">712.</div>

<p>About the beginning of the eighth Century,
during the Reign of <i>Roderick</i>, the last
King of the <i>Goths</i>, the <i>Moors</i>, or rather the
<i>Arabians</i>, <i>Valid Almanzor</i> being their Caliph,
enter'd <i>Spain</i>. They were received and assisted
by <i>Julian</i>, an <i>Italian</i> Nobleman, who
made the Conquest of those Places easy,
which might otherwise have proved difficult,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
not out of any Affection to the <i>Arabians</i>, but
from a Desire of revenging himself on <i>Roderick</i>,
who had debauched his Daughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">717.</div>

<p>The <i>Arabians</i> soon made themselves Masters
of all the Country between the Streights
of <i>Gibraltar</i> and the <i>Pyrenees</i>, excepting the
Mountains of <i>Asturia</i>; where the Christians,
commanded by Prince <i>Pelagus</i>, fled, who
founded the Kingdom <i>Oviedo</i> or <i>Leon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Portugal</i>, with the rest of <i>Spain</i>, became
subject to the Infidels. In each respective
Province, Governours were appointed, who
after the Death of <i>Almanzor</i> revolted from
his Successor, made themselves independent
of any other Power, and took the Title of
Sovereign Princes.</p>

<p>They were driven out of <i>Portugal</i> about
the beginning of the twelfth Century, by
<i>Henry</i> Count of <i>Burgundy</i>, Son to <i>Robert</i> King
of <i>France</i>. This Prince, full of the same
Zeal which excited so many others to engage
in a holy War, went into <i>Spain</i> on purpose to
attack the Infidels; and such Courage, such
Conduct did he show, that <i>Alphonso</i> VI. King
of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>, made him General of his
Army: and afterwards, that he might for
ever engage so brave a Soldier, he married
him to one of his Daughters, named <i>Teresia</i>,
and gave him all those Places from which he
had driven the <i>Moors</i>. The Count, by new
Conquests, extended his Dominions, and
founded the Kingdom of <i>Portugal</i>, but never
gave himself the Royal Title.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1139.</div>

<p><i>Alphonso</i>, his Son, did not only inherit his
Father's Dominions, but his Virtues also; and
not content with what the Count his Father had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
left him, he vigorously carried on the War,
and encreas'd his Territories. Having obtained
a signal Victory over the <i>Arabians</i>, his
Soldiers unanimously proclaimed him King;
which Title his Successors have ever since
borne.</p>

<p>And now this Family had sway'd the Scepter
of <i>Portugal</i> for almost the space of five
hundred Years, when Don <i>Sebastian</i> came to
the Crown; he was the posthumous Son of
Don <i>John</i>, who died some time before his
Father, Don <i>John</i> III. Son of the renowned
King <i>Emanuel</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1557.</div>

<p>Don <i>Sebastian</i> was not above three Years of
Age when the old King died; his Grandmother
<i>Catherine</i>, of the House of <i>Austria</i>,
Daughter to <i>Philip</i> I. King of <i>Castile</i>, and Sister
to the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. was made Regent
of <i>Portugal</i> during his Minority. Don
<i>Alexis de Menezes</i>, a Nobleman noted for his
singular Piety, was appointed Governour to
the young King, and Don <i>Lewis de Camara</i>,
a Jesuit, was named for his Tutor.</p>

<p>From such Teachers as these, what might
not be expected? They filled his Mind
with Sentiments of Honour, and his Soul
with Devotion. But, (which may at first
appear strange or impossible) these Notions
were too often, and too strongly inculcated
in him.</p>

<p><i>Menezes</i> was always telling the young
Prince what Victories his Predecessors had
obtain'd over the <i>Moors</i> in the <i>Indies</i>, and in
almost every part of <i>Africa</i>. On the other
hand, the Jesuit was perpetually teaching
him, that the Crown of Kings was the immediate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Gift of <i>God</i>, and that therefore the
chiefest Duty of a Prince was to propagate
the Holy Gospel, and to have the Word of
the <i>Lord</i> preached to those Nations, who had
never heard of the Name of <i>Christ</i>.</p>

<p>These different Ideas of Honour and Religion
made a deep impression on the Heart
of Don <i>Sebastian</i>, who was naturally pious.
Scarce therefore had he taken the Government
of <i>Portugal</i> upon himself, but he thought
of transporting an Army into <i>Africa</i>; and to
that end he often conferr'd with his Officers,
but oftener with his Missionaries and other
Ecclesiasticks.</p>

<p>A Civil War breaking out about this time in
<i>Morocco</i>, seem'd very much to favour his Design.
The Occasion was this: <i>Muley Mahomet</i> had
caus'd himself to be proclaim'd King of <i>Morocco</i>
after the Death of <i>Abdalla</i>, his Father;
<i>Muley Moluc</i>, <i>Abdalla</i>'s Brother, opposed him,
objecting that he had ascended the Throne
contrary to the Law of the Cherifs, by
which it is ordained, That the Crown shall
devolve to the King's Brethren, if he has
any, and his Sons be excluded the Succession.
This occasion'd a bloody War between the
Uncle and the Nephew; but <i>Muley Moluc</i>,
who was as brave a Soldier as he was a wise
Commander, defeated <i>Mahomet</i>'s Army in
three pitch'd Battles, and drove him out of
<i>Africa</i>.</p>

<p>The exil'd Prince fled for Refuge to the
Court of <i>Portugal</i>, and finding Access to Don
<i>Sebastian</i>, told him, that notwithstanding his
Misfortunes, there were still a considerable
Number of his Subjects, who were loyal in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
their Hearts, and wanted only an Opportunity
of declaring themselves in his favour.
That besides this, he was very well assured
that <i>Moluc</i> was afflicted with a lingring Disease,
which prey'd upon his Vitals; that
<i>Hamet</i>, <i>Moluc</i>'s Brother, was not belov'd by
the People; that therefore if Don <i>Sebastian</i>
would but send him with a small Army into
<i>Africa</i>, so many of his Subjects would come
over to him, that he did not in the least
question but that he should soon re-establish
himself in his Father's Dominions: which, if
he did recover by these means, the Kingdom
should become tributary to the Crown of
<i>Portugal</i>; nay, that he would much rather
have Don <i>Sebastian</i> himself fill the Throne of
<i>Morocco</i>, than see it in possession of the present
Usurper.</p>

<p>Don <i>Sebastian</i>, who was ever entertaining
himself with the Ideas of future Conquests,
thought this Opportunity of planting the
Christian Religion in <i>Morocco</i> was not to be
neglected; and therefore promis'd the <i>Moorish</i>
King not only his Assistance, but rashly engaged
himself in the Expedition, giving out
that he intended to command the Army in
Person. The wisest of his Counsellors in
vain endeavour'd to dissuade him from the
dangerous Design. His Zeal, his Courage,
an inconsiderate Rashness, the common Fault
of Youth, as well as some Flatterers, the
Bane of Royalty, and Destruction of Princes,
all prompted him to continue fixed in his
Resolution, and persuaded him that he needed
only appear in <i>Africa</i> to overcome, and
that his Conquests would be both easy and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
glorious. To this end he embarked with an
Army of Thirteen Thousand Men, with
which he was to drive a powerful Prince out
of his own Dominions.</p>

<p><i>Moluc</i> had timely notice given him of the
<i>Portuguese</i> Expedition, and of their landing in
<i>Africa</i>; he had put himself at the head of
Forty Thousand Horsemen, all disciplin'd Soldiers,
and who were not so much to be
dreaded for their Number and Courage, as
they were for the Conduct of their General.
His Infantry he did not at all value himself
upon, not having above Ten Thousand Regular
Men; there was indeed a vast Number of
the Militia, and others of the People who came
pouring down to his Assistance, but these he
justly look'd upon as Men who were rather
come to plunder than to fight, and who
would at any time side with the Conqueror.</p>

<p>Several Skirmishes were fought, but <i>Moluc</i>'s
Officers had private Orders still to fly
before the Foe, hoping thereby to make the
<i>Portuguese</i> leave the Shore, where they had
intrench'd themselves. This Stratagem had
its desir'd Effect; for Don <i>Sebastian</i> observing
that the <i>Moors</i> still fled before him, order'd
his Army to leave their Intrenchments, and
marched against the Foe as to a certain Victory.
<i>Moluc</i> made his Army retire, as if he
did not dare to fight a decisive Battle; nay,
sent Messengers to Don <i>Sebastian</i>, who pretended
they were order'd to treat of Peace.
The King of <i>Portugal</i> immediately concluded,
that his Adversary was doubtful of the Success
of the War, and that 'twould be an easier
matter to overcome <i>Moluc</i>'s Army, than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to join them; he therefore indefatigably pursued
them. But the <i>Moor</i> had no sooner
drawn him far enough from the Shore, and
made it impossible for him to retire to his
Fleet, but he halted, faced the <i>Portuguese</i>,
and put his Army in Battalia; the Horse making
a half Circle, with intent, as soon as
they engaged, to surround the Enemy on
every side. <i>Moluc</i> made <i>Hamet</i>, his Brother
and Successor, Commander in chief of the
Cavalry; but as he doubted his Courage, he
came up to him a little before the Engagement,
told him that he must either conquer
or die, and that should he prove Coward enough
to turn his back upon the Foe, he
would strangle him with his own hand.</p>

<p>The reason why <i>Moluc</i> did not command the
Army himself, was, that he was sensible of the
Increase of his lingring Disease, and found that
in all probability this Day would be his last,
and therefore resolved to make it the most
glorious of his Life. He put his Army, as I
said before, in Battalia himself, and gave all
the necessary Orders with as much Presence
of Mind, as if he had enjoy'd the greatest
Health. He went farther than this; for foreseeing
what a sudden Damp the News of his
Death might cast upon the Courage of his
Soldiers, he order'd the Officers that were
about him, that if during the Heat of the
Battle he should die, they should carefully
conceal it, and that even after his Death, his
<i>Aides de Camp</i> should come up to his Litter,
as if to receive fresh Orders. After this he
was carried from Rank to Rank, where he
exhorted his Soldiers to fight bravely for the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Defence of their Religion and their Country.</p>

<p>But now the Combat began, and the great
Artillery being discharg'd, the Armies join'd.
The <i>Portuguese</i> Infantry soon routed the
<i>Moorish</i> Foot-Soldiers, who, as was before
mention'd, were raw and undisciplin'd; the
Duke <i>d'Aviedo</i> engaged with a Parry of Horse
so happily, that they gave ground, and retir'd
to the very Center of the Army, where
the King was. Enraged at so unexpected a
Sight, notwithstanding what his Officers
could say or do, he threw himself out of his
Litter; Sword in hand he clear'd himself a
Passage, rallied his flying Soldiers, and led
them back himself to the Engagement. But
this Action quite exhausting his remaining
Strength and Spirits, he fainted; his Officers
put him into his Litter, where he just recover'd
Strength enough to put his Finger upon
his Mouth once more, to enjoin Secrecy,
then died before they could convey him back
to his Tent. His Commands were obey'd,
and the News of his Death conceal'd.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Aug. 4.<br />
1578.</i></div>

<p>Hitherto the Christians seem'd to have the
Advantage, but the <i>Moorish</i> Horse advancing
at last, hemm'd in <i>Sebastian</i>'s whole Army,
and attack'd them on every side. The Cavalry
was drove back upon their Infantry,
whom they trampled under foot, and spread
every where amongst their own Soldiers, Disorder,
Fear, and Confusion. The Infidels
seiz'd upon this Advantage, and Sword in
hand fell upon the conquer'd Troops; a
dreadful Slaughter ensu'd, some on their
knees begg'd for quarter, others thought to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
save themselves by flight, but being surrounded
by their Foes, met their Fate in another
place. The rash Don <i>Sebastian</i> himself
was slain, but whether he fell amidst the
Horror and Confusion of the Battle, not being
known by the <i>Moors</i>, or whether he was
resolv'd not to survive the Loss of so many
of his Subjects, whom he had led on to a
Field of Slaughter, is doubtful. <i>Muley Mahomet</i>
got off, but passing the River <i>Mucazen</i>,
was drown'd. Thus perish'd, in one fatal
Day, three Heroick Princes.</p>

<p>The Cardinal, Don Henry, great Uncle to
Don <i>Sebastian</i>, succeeded him; he was Brother
to <i>John</i> III. the late King's Grandfather,
and Son to <i>Emanuel</i>. During his Reign, his
pretended Heirs made all the Interest they
could in the Court of <i>Portugal</i>, being well
assur'd that the present King, who was weak
and sickly, and sixty-seven Years old, could
not be long-liv'd; nor could he marry, and
leave Children behind him, for he was a Cardinal,
and in Priest's Orders. The Succession
was claim'd by <i>Philip</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>;
<i>Catherine</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, espous'd to Don <i>James</i>,
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>; by the Duke of <i>Savoy</i>;
the Duke of <i>Parma</i>; and by <i>Antonio</i>, Grand
Prior of <i>Crete</i>: They all publish'd their respective
Manifesto's, in which every one declar'd
their Pretensions to the Crown.</p>

<p><i>Philip</i> was Son to the Infanta <i>Isabella</i>, eldest
Daughter of King <i>Emanuel</i>. The Dutchess
of <i>Braganza</i> was Granddaughter to the same
King <i>Emanuel</i>, by <i>Edward</i> his second Son.
The Duke of <i>Savoy</i>'s Mother was the Princess
<i>Beatrix</i>, a younger Sister of the Empress
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>Isabella</i>. The Duke of <i>Parma</i> was Son to
<i>Mary</i> of <i>Portugal</i>, the second Daughter of
Prince <i>Edward</i>, and Sister to the Dutchess of
<i>Braganza</i>. Don <i>Lewis</i>, Duke of <i>Beja</i>, was
second Son to King <i>Emanuel</i> by <i>Violenta</i>, the
finest Lady of that Age, whom he had debauch'd,
but whom the Grand Prior pretended
to have been privately married to that
Prince. <i>Catherine de Medicis</i>, amongst the
rest, made her Claim, as being descended from
<i>Alphonso</i> III. King of <i>Portugal</i>, and <i>Maud</i>
Countess of <i>Bolonia</i>. The <i>Pope</i> too put in
his Claim; he would have it, that after the
Reign of the <i>Cardinal</i>, <i>Portugal</i> must be look'd
upon as a fat Living in his Gift, and to
which, like many a modern Patron, he would
willingly have presented himself.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all their Pretensions,
it plainly appear'd that the Succession belong'd
either to <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Spain</i>, or to
the Dutchess of <i>Braganza</i>, a Lady of an extraordinary
Merit, and belov'd by the whole
Nation. The Duke, her Spouse, was descended,
tho not in a direct Line, from the
Royal Blood, and she herself was sprung
from Prince <i>Edward</i>; whereas the King of
<i>Spain</i> was Son to <i>Edward</i>'s Sister: besides,
by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom,
all Strangers were excluded the Succession.
This <i>Philip</i> own'd, since thereby the Pretensions
of <i>Savoy</i> and <i>Parma</i> vanish'd; but he
would by no means acknowledge himself a
Stranger in <i>Portugal</i>, which he said had often
been part of the Dominions of the King of
<i>Castile</i>. Each had their several Parties at
Court, and the <i>Cardinal</i> King was daily
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
press'd to decide the Difference, but always
evaded it; he could not bear to hear of his
Successors, and would willingly have liv'd to
have bury'd all his pretended Heirs: however,
his Reign lasted but 17 Months, and
by his Death <i>Portugal</i> became the unhappy
Theatre of Civil Wars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1580.</div>

<p>By his last Will he had order'd, that a Juncto,
or Assembly of the States, should be call'd,
to settle the Succession; but King <i>Philip</i> not
caring to wait for their Decision, sent a powerful
Army into <i>Portugal</i>, commanded by the
Duke of <i>Alba</i>, which ended the Dispute, and
put <i>Philip</i> in possession of that Kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1581.</div>

<p>We cannot find that the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>
us'd any Endeavours to assert his Right by
force of Arms. The Grand Prior indeed did
all he could to oppose the <i>Castilians</i>; the Mob
had proclaim'd him King, and he took the
Title upon him, as if it had been given by
the States of <i>Portugal</i>: and his Friends rais'd
some Forces for him, but they were soon cut
in pieces by the Duke of <i>Alba</i>, than whom
<i>Spain</i> could not have chosen a better General.
As much as the <i>Portuguese</i> hate the <i>Castilians</i>,
yet could they not keep them out, being
disunited among themselves, and having no
General, nor any Regular Troops on foot.
Most of the Towns, for fear of being plunder'd,
capitulated, and made each their several
Treaty; so that in a short time <i>Philip</i>
was acknowledg'd their lawful Sovereign by
the whole Nation, as being next Heir Male
to his great Uncle, the late King: of such
wondrous use is open Force to support a
bad Cause!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>After him reign'd his Son and Grandson,
<i>Philip</i> III. and IV. who us'd the <i>Portuguese</i>
not like Subjects, but like a conquer'd People;
and the Kingdom of <i>Portugal</i> saw itself
dwindle into a Province of <i>Spain</i>, and
so weaken'd, that there was no hope left of
recovering their Liberty: Their Noblemen
durst not appear in an Equipage suitable to
their Birth, for fear of making the <i>Spanish</i>
Ministers jealous of their Greatness or Riches;
the Gentry were confin'd to their Country-Seats,
and the People oppress'd with Taxes.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Olivarez</i>, who was then first
Minister to <i>Philip</i> IV. King of <i>Spain</i>, was
firmly persuaded, that all means were to be
us'd to exhaust this new Conquest; he was
sensible of the natural Antipathy of the <i>Portuguese</i>
and <i>Castilians</i>, and thought that the
former could never calmly behold their chief
Posts fill'd with Strangers, or at best with
<i>Portuguese</i> of a <i>Plebeian</i> Extraction, who had
nothing else to recommend 'em but their
Zeal for the Service of <i>Spain</i>. He thought
therefore, that the surest way of establishing
King <i>Philip</i>'s Power, was to remove the Nobility
of <i>Portugal</i> from all Places of Trust,
and so to impoverish the People, that they
should never be capable of attempting to
shake off the <i>Spanish</i> Yoke. Besides this, he employ'd
the <i>Portuguese</i> Youth in foreign Wars,
resolving to drain the Kingdom of all those
who were capable of bearing Arms.</p>

<p>As politick as this Conduct of <i>Olivarez</i>
might appear, yet did he miss his aim; for
carrying his Cruelty to too high a pitch, at
a time when the Court of <i>Spain</i> was in distress,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and seeming rather to plunder an Enemy's
Country, than levying Taxes from the <i>Portuguese</i>,
who daily saw their Miseries encrease,
and be the consequence of their Attempt
what it would, they could never fare
worse; unanimously resolv'd to free themselves
from the intolerable Tyranny of
Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1640.</div>

<p><i>Margaret of Savoy</i>, Dutchess of <i>Mantua</i>,
was then in <i>Portugal</i>, where she had the Title
of Vice-Queen, but was very far from having
the Power. <i>Miguel Vasconcellos</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>
by Birth, but attach'd to the <i>Spanish</i> Interest,
had the Name of Secretary of State, but
was indeed an absolute and independent Minister,
and dispatch'd, without the knowledge
of the Vice-Queen, all the secret Business;
his Orders he receiv'd directly from
<i>d'Olivarez</i>, whose Creature he was, and who
found him absolutely necessary for extorting
vast Sums of Money from the <i>Portuguese</i>. He
was so deeply learn'd in the Art of Intriguing,
that he could perpetually make the
Nobility jealous of one another, then would
he foment their Divisions, and encrease their
Animosities, whereby the <i>Spanish</i> Government
became every day more absolute; for the
Duke was assur'd, that whilst the Grandees
were engag'd in private Quarrels, they would
never think of the Common Cause.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Braganza</i> was the only Man
in all <i>Portugal</i>, of whom the <i>Spaniards</i> were
now jealous. His Humour was agreeable,
and the chief thing he consulted was his
Ease. He was a Man rather of sound Sense,
than quick Wit. He could easily make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Master of any Business to which he apply'd
his Mind, but then he never car'd
much for the Trouble on't. Don <i>Theodosius</i>,
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, his Father, was of a fiery
and passionate Temper, and had taken care
to infuse in his Son's Mind an Hereditary
Aversion to the <i>Spaniards</i>, who had usurp'd
a Crown, that of Right belonged to him; to
swell his Mind with the Ambition of repossessing
himself of a Throne, which his Ancestors
had been unjustly depriv'd of; and
to fill his Soul with all the Courage that
would be necessary for the carrying on of so
great a Design.</p>

<p>Nor was this Prince's Care wholly lost;
Don <i>John</i> had imbib'd as much of the Sentiments
of his Father as were consistent with
so mild and easy a Temper. He abhorr'd
the <i>Spaniards</i>, yet was not at all uneasy at
his Incapacity of revenging himself. He entertain'd
Hopes of ascending the Throne of
<i>Portugal</i>, yet did he not shew the least Impatience,
as Duke <i>Theodosius</i>, his Father, had
done, but contented himself with a distant
Prospect of a Crown; nor would for an Uncertainty
venture the Quiet of his Life, and
a Fortune which was already greater than
what was well consistent with the Condition
of a Subject. Had he been precisely what
Duke <i>Theodosius</i> wish'd him, he had never
been fit for the great Design; for <i>d'Olivarez</i>
had him observ'd so strictly, that had his easy
and pleasant manner of Living proceeded
from any other Cause but a natural Inclination,
it had certainly been discover'd, and
the Discovery had prov'd fatal both to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Life and Fortune: at least the Court of <i>Spain</i>
would never have suffer'd him to live in so
splendid a manner in the very Heart of his
Country.</p>

<p>Had he been the most refin'd Politician, he
could never have liv'd in a manner less capable
of giving Suspicion. His Birth, his
Riches, his Title to the Crown, were not
criminal in themselves, but became so by the
Law of Policy. This he was very sensible
of, and therefore chose this way of Living,
prompted to it as well by Nature as by Reason.
It would have been a Crime to be formidable,
he must therefore take care not to
appear so: At <i>Villa-Viciosa</i>, the Seat of the
Dukes of <i>Braganza</i>, nothing was thought of
but Hunting-Matches, and other Rural Diversions;
the Brightness of his Parts could
not in the least make the <i>Spaniards</i> apprehend
any bold Undertaking, but the Solidity
of his Understanding made the <i>Portuguese</i>
promise themselves the Enjoyment of a
mild and easy King, provided they would
undertake to raise him to the Throne. But
an Accident soon after happen'd, which very
much alarm'd <i>Olivarez</i>.</p>

<p>Some new Taxes being laid upon the People
of <i>Evora</i>, which they were not able to
pay, reduc'd 'em to Despair; upon which
they rose in a tumultuous manner, loudly exclaiming
against the <i>Spanish</i> Tyranny, and
declaring themselves in favour of the House
of <i>Braganza</i>. Then, but too late, the Court
of <i>Spain</i> began to be sensible of their Error,
in leaving so rich and powerful a Prince in
the Heart of a Kingdom so lately subdued,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and to whose Crown he had such Legal Pretensions.</p>

<p>This made the Council of <i>Spain</i> immediately
determine, that it was necessary to secure
the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, or at best not to let him
make any longer stay in <i>Portugal</i>. To this end
they nam'd him Governour of <i>Milan</i>, which
Government he refus'd, alledging the Weakness
of his Constitution for an Excuse: besides,
he said he was wholly unacquainted
with the Affairs of <i>Italy</i>, and by consequence
not capable of acquitting himself in so weighty
a Post.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">1640.</div>

<p>The Duke <i>d'Olivarez</i>, seem'd to approve
of the Excuse, and therefore began to think
of some new Expedient to draw him to
Court. The King's marching at the head of
his Army to the Frontiers of <i>Arragon</i>, to
suppress the rebelling <i>Catalonians</i>, was a very
good Pretence; he wrote to the Duke of
<i>Braganza</i>, "to come at the head of the <i>Portuguese</i>
Nobility to serve the King in an
Expedition, which could not but be glorious,
since his Majesty commanded it in
Person." The Duke, who had no great
relish for any Favour confer'd by the Court
of <i>Spain</i>, excus'd himself, upon pretence that
"his Birth would oblige him to be at a much
greater Expence than what he was at present
able to support."</p>

<p>This second Refusal alarm'd <i>d'Olivarez</i>.
Notwithstanding Don <i>John</i>'s easy Temper,
he began to be afraid that the <i>Evorians</i> had
made an impression upon his Thoughts, by
reminding him of his Right to the Throne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
It was dangerous to leave him any longer in
his Country, and equally dangerous to hurry
him out of it by force; so great a Love had
the <i>Portuguese</i> ever bore to the House of <i>Braganza</i>,
so great a Respect did they bear to
this Duke in particular. He must therefore
treacherously be drawn into <i>Spain</i>, nor could
any properer means be thought of, for compassing
this end, than by shewing him all the
seeming Tokens of an unfeigned Friendship.</p>

<p><i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i> were at that time engag'd
in War, and the <i>French</i> Fleet had been seen
off the Coasts of <i>Portugal</i>. This gave the
<i>Spanish</i> Minister a fair opportunity of accomplishing
his Ends; for it was necessary to
have an Army on foot, under the Command
of some brave General, to hinder the <i>French</i>
from making a Descent, or landing any where
in <i>Portugal</i>. The Commission was sent to
the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, with an absolute Authority
over all the Towns and Garisons, as
well as a Power over the Maritime Forces;
in short, so unlimited was the Command given
him, that the Minister seem'd blindly to
have deliver'd all <i>Portugal</i> into his power:
but this was only the better to colour his
Design. Don <i>Lopez Ozorio</i>, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral,
had private Orders sent him, that as
soon as Don <i>John</i> should visit any of the
Ports, he should put in, as if drove by stress
of Weather; then artfully invite the General
aboard, immediately hoist sail, and with all
possible expedition bring him into <i>Spain</i>. But
propitious Fortune seem'd to have taken him
into her Protection; a violent Storm arose,
which dispers'd the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which suffer'd shipwreck, and the rest were
so shatter'd, that they could not make <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p>This ill Success did not in the least discourage
<i>Olivarez</i>, or make him drop his Project;
he attributed the Escape of the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i> to meer Chance: he wrote him a
Letter, full of Expressions of Friendship,
and as if he had with him shar'd the Government
of the whole Kingdom, wherein he
deplor'd the Loss of the Fleet, and told him,
that the King now expected that he would
carefully review all the Ports and their respective
Fortifications, seeing that the Fleet,
which was to defend the Coasts of <i>Portugal</i>
from the Insults of the <i>French</i>, had miserably
perish'd. And that his Villany might not be
suspected, he return'd him Forty Thousand
Ducats to defray his Expences, and to raise
more Troops, in case there should be a necessity
of them. At the same time he sent
private Orders to all the Governours of Forts
and Citadels, (the greatest part whereof were
<i>Spaniards</i>) that if they should find a favourable
occasion of securing the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>,
they should do it, and forthwith convey
him into <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>This entire Confidence which was repos'd
in him, alarm'd the Duke; he plainly saw
that there was Treachery intended, and
therefore thought it just to return the Treachery.
He wrote an Answer to <i>Olivarez</i>,
wherein he told him, that with Joy he accepted
the Honour which the King had confer'd
upon him, in naming him his General,
and promis'd so to discharge the important
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Trust, as to deserve the Continuation of his
Majesty's Favour.</p>

<p>But now the Duke began to have a nearer
Prospect of the Throne; nor did he neglect
this opportunity of putting some of his
Friends into Places of Trust, that they might
be the more able to serve him upon occasion;
he also employ'd part of the <i>Spanish</i> Money
in making new Creatures, and confirming
those in his Interest whom he had already
made. And as he partly mistrusted the <i>Spaniards</i>
Design, he never visited any Fort, but he
was surrounded by such a Number of Friends,
that it was impossible for the Governours to
execute their Orders.</p>

<p>Mean while the Court of <i>Spain</i> loudly
murmur'd at the Trust which was repos'd in
Don <i>John</i>, they were ignorant of the Prime
Minister's Aim, and therefore some did not
stick to tell the King, that his near Alliance
to the House of <i>Braganza</i> made him overlook
his Master's Interest; seeing that it was the
highest Imprudence to put so absolute an
Authority into the hands of one who had
such Pretensions to the Crown, and to entrust
the Army to the Command of one, who in
all probability might make the Soldiers turn
their Arms against their lawful Sovereign.
But the more they complain'd, the better
was the King pleas'd, being persuaded that
the Plot was artfully laid, since no one could
unravel the dark Design. Thus <i>Braganza</i>
not only had the liberty, but was oblig'd to
visit all <i>Portugal</i>, and by that means laid the
Foundation of his future Fortune. The
Eyes of the Many were every where drawn
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by his magnificent Equipage, all that came to
him, he mildly, and with unequal'd Goodness
heard; the Soldiers were not suffer'd to
commit the least Disorders, and he laid hold
of all Opportunities of praising the Conduct
of the Officers, and by frequent Recompences
bestow'd upon them, won their Hearts.
The Nobility were charm'd with his free Deportment,
he receiv'd every one of them in
the most obliging manner, and paid each the
Respect due to his Quality. In short, such
was his Carriage, that the People began to
think there could be no greater Happiness
for them upon Earth, than the Restoration
of the Prince to the Throne of his
Ancestors.</p>

<p>Mean while his Party omitted nothing
that they thought might contribute to the
establishing of his Reputation. Amongst others,
<i>Pinto Ribeiro</i>, Comptroller of his Household,
particularly distinguish'd himself, and
was the first who form'd an exact Scheme for
the Advancement of his Master. There was
no Man more experienc'd in Business, who
at the same time was so careful, diligent, and
watchful: he was firm to the Interest of the
Duke, not doubting but that if he could
raise him to the Throne, he should raise himself
to some considerable Post. His Master
had often privately assur'd him, that he would
willingly lay hold of any fair Opportunity
for his Restoration, yet would not rashly declare
himself, as a Man who had nothing to
lose; that notwithstanding he might endeavour
to gain the Minds of the People, and
to make new Creatures, yet he must do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
with that Caution, that it might appear his
own Work, and done without the Consent
and Knowledge of the Duke.</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i> had spar'd no pains in discovering
who were, and the Number of the Disaffected,
which he daily endeavoured to encrease;
he rail'd against the present Government
sometimes with Heat, at other times
with Caution, always accommodating himself
to the Humour of the Company which
he was in: tho indeed so great was the Hatred
which the <i>Portuguese</i> bore the <i>Spaniards</i>,
that there was no need of Reserve in complaining
of them. He would often remind
the Nobility what honourable Employments
their Forefathers had borne, when <i>Portugal</i>
was govern'd by its own Kings. Then
would he mention the Summons which had
so much exasperated the Nobility, and by
which they were commanded to attend the
King in <i>Catalonia</i>. <i>Pinto</i> us'd to complain of
this Hardship as of a kind of Banishment,
from which they would scarce find it possible
to return; that the Pride of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
who would command them, was insufferable,
and the Expence they should be
at intolerable; that this was only a plausible
Pretence to drain <i>Portugal</i> of its bravest Men,
that in all their Expeditions they might be
assur'd of being expos'd where the greatest
Danger was, but that they must never hope
to share the least part of the Glory.</p>

<p>When he was amongst the Merchants and
other Citizens, he would bewail the Misery
of his Country, which was ruin'd by the
Injustice of the <i>Spaniard</i>, who had transfer'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the Trade, which <i>Portugal</i> carried on with
the <i>Indies</i>, to <i>Cadiz</i>. Then would he remind
them of the Felicity which the <i>Dutch</i> and
<i>Catalonians</i> enjoy'd, who had shaken off the
<i>Spanish</i> Yoke. As for the Clergy, he did not
in the least question but that he should engage
'em in his Interest, and exasperate 'em
most irreconcileably against the <i>Castilians</i>; he
told them, that the Immunities and Privileges
of the Church were violated, their
Orders contemn'd and neglected, and that
all the best Preferments and fattest Livings
were possess'd by foreign Incumbents.</p>

<p>When he was with those, of whose Disaffection
he was already convinc'd, he would
take care to turn his Discourse to his Master,
and talk of his manner of Living. He
would often complain, that that Prince shew'd
too little Affection for the Good of his
Country, and Concern for his own Interest;
and that at a time when it was in his power
to assert his Title to the Crown, he should
seem so regardless of his own Right, and
lead so idle a Life. Finding that these Insinuations
made an impression upon the People,
he went still farther: To those who were
publick-spirited, he represented what a
glorious thing it would be for them to lay
the Foundations of a Revolution, and to deserve
the Name of <i>Deliverers of their Country</i>.
Those who had been injur'd and ill-treated
by the <i>Spaniards</i>, he would excite to the Desire
of Revenge; and the Ambitious he flatter'd
with a Prospect of the Grandeurs and
Preferments they might expect from the new
King, would they once raise him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Throne. In short, he manag'd every thing
with so much Art, that being privately assur'd
of the unshaken Affection of many to
his Master, he procur'd a Meeting of a considerable
Number of the Nobility, with the
Archbishop of <i>Lisbon</i> at the head of them.</p>

<p>This Prelate was of the House of <i>Acugna</i>,
one of the best Families of all <i>Portugal</i>; he
was a Man of Learning, and an excellent Politician,
belov'd by the People, but hated by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and whom he had also just
cause to hate, since they had made Don
<i>Sebastian Maltos de Norognia</i>, Archbishop of
Braga, President of the Chamber of <i>Opaco</i>,
whom they had all along prefer'd to him, and
to whom they had given a great share in the
Administration of Affairs.</p>

<p>Another of the most considerable Members
of this Assembly, was Don <i>Miguel d'Almeida</i>,
a venerable old Man, and who deserv'd, and
had the Esteem of every body; he was very
publick-spirited, and was not so much griev'd
at his own private Misfortunes, as at those
of his Country, whose Inhabitants were become
the Slaves of an usurping Tyrant. In
these Sentiments he had been educated, and
to these with undaunted Courage and Resolution
he still adher'd; nor could the Entreaties
of his Relations, nor the repeated
Advices of his Friends, ever make him go to
Court, or cringe to the <i>Spanish</i> Ministers.
This Carriage of his had made them jealous
of him. This therefore was the Man whom
<i>Pinto</i> first cast his eyes upon, being well assur'd
that he might safely entrust him with
the Secret; besides which, no one could be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
more useful in carrying on their Design, his
Interest with the Nobility being so great,
that he could easily bring over a considerable
Number of them to his Party.</p>

<p>There were, besides these two, at this
first Meeting, Don <i>Antonio d'Almada</i>, an intimate
Friend of the Archbishop's, with Don
<i>Lewis</i>, his Son; Don <i>Lewis d'Acugna</i>, Nephew
to that Prelate, and who had married
Don <i>Antonio d'Almada</i>'s Daughter; <i>Mello</i>
Lord <i>Ranger</i>, Don <i>George</i> his Brother; <i>Pedro
Mendoza</i>; Don <i>Rodrigo de Saa</i>, Lord-Chamberlain:
with several other Officers of
the Houshold, whose Places were nothing
now but empty Titles, since <i>Portugal</i> had lost
her own natural Kings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conostagio.</div>

<p>The Archbishop, who was naturally a
good Rhetorician, broke the Ice in this Assembly;
he made an eloquent Speech, in
which he set forth the many Grievances <i>Portugal</i>
had labour'd under since it had been
subject to the Domination of <i>Spain</i>. He reminded
them of the Number of Nobility
which <i>Philip</i> II. had butchered to secure his
Conquest; nor had he been more favourable
to the Church, witness the famous Brief of
Absolution, which he had obtain'd from the
Pope for the Murder of Two Thousand
Priests, or others of Religious Orders, whom
he had barbarously put to death, on no other
account but to secure his Usurpation: And
since that unhappy time the <i>Spaniards</i> had not
chang'd their inhuman Policy; how many had
fallen for no other Crime but their unshaken
Love to their Country! That none of those
who were there present, could call their Lives
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
or their Estates their own: That the Nobility
were slighted and remov'd from all Places
of Trust, Profit, or Power: That the Church
was fill'd with a scandalous Clergy, since <i>Vasconcellos</i>
had dispos'd of all the Livings, and to
which he had prefer'd his own Creatures only:
That the People were oppress'd with
excessive Taxes, whilst the Earth remain'd
untill'd for want of hands, their Labourers
being all sent away by force, for Soldiers to
<i>Catalonia</i>: That this last Summons for the
Nobility to attend the King, was only a specious
Pretence to force them out of their
own Country, lest their Presence might prove
an Obstacle to some cruel Design, which was
doubtless on foot: That the mildest Fate
they could hope for, was a tedious, if not a
perpetual Banishment; and that whilst they
were ill-treated by the <i>Castilians</i> abroad,
Strangers should enjoy their Estates, and
new Colonies take possession of their Habitations.
He concluded by assuring them, that
so great were the Miseries of his Country,
that he would rather chuse to die ten thousand
Deaths, than be obliged to see the Encrease
of them; nor would he now entertain
one thought of Life, did he not hope that
so many Persons of Quality were not met together
in vain.</p>

<p>This Discourse had its desir'd effect, by
reminding every one of the many Evils which
they had suffer'd. Each seem'd earnest to
give some instance of <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Cruelty.
The Estates of some had been unjustly
confiscated, whilst others had Hereditary
Places and Governments taken from them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
some had been long confin'd in Prisons thro
the Jealousy of the <i>Spanish</i> Ministers, and
many bewail'd a Father, a Brother, or a
Friend, either detain'd at <i>Madrid</i>, or sent
into <i>Catalonia</i> as Hostages of the Fidelity of
their unhappy Countrymen. In short, there
was not one of those who were engag'd in
this Publick Cause, but what had some private
Quarrel to revenge: but nothing provoked
them more than the <i>Catalonian</i> Expedition;
they plainly saw, that it was not
so much the want of their assistance, as the
desire of ruining them, which made the <i>Spanish</i>
Minister oblige them to that tedious and
expensive Voyage. These Considerations,
join'd to their own private Animosities, made
'em unanimously resolve to venture Life and
Fortune, rather than any longer to bear the
heavy Yoke: but the Form of Government
which they ought to chuse, caus'd a Division
amongst them. Part of the Assembly
were for making themselves a Republick, as
<i>Holland</i> had lately done; others were for a
Monarchy, but could not agree upon the
choice of a King: some propos'd the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i>, some the Marquis de <i>Villareal</i>,
and others the Duke <i>d'Aviedo</i>, (all three
Princes of the Royal Blood of <i>Portugal</i>,)
according as their different Inclinations or
Interests byass'd them. But the Archbishop,
who was wholly devoted to the House
of <i>Braganza</i>, assuming the Authority of his
Character, set forth with great strength of
Reason, That the Choice of a Government
was not in their power; that the Oath of
Allegiance which they had taken to the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of <i>Spain</i>, could not in conscience be broken,
unless it was with a design to restore their
rightful Sovereign to the Throne of his Fathers,
which every one knew to be the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i>; that they must therefore resolve
to proclaim him King, or for ever to continue
under the Tyranny of the <i>Spanish</i> Usurper.
After this, he made 'em consider the Power
and Riches of this Prince, as well as the
great number of his Vassals, on whom depended
almost a third part of the Kingdom.
He shew'd 'em it was impossible for 'em to
drive the <i>Spaniards</i> out of <i>Portugal</i>, unless he
was at their head: that the only way to
engage him, would be by making him an
Offer of the Crown, which they would be
under a Necessity of doing, altho he was not
the first Prince of the Royal Blood. Then began
he to reckon all those excellent Qualities
with which he was endow'd, as his Wisdom,
his Prudence; but above all, his affable Behaviour,
and inimitable Goodness. In short,
his Words prevail'd so well upon every one,
that they unanimously declared him their
King, and promis'd that they would spare
no Pains, no Endeavours to engage him to
enter into their Measures: after which, having
agreed upon the time and place of a
second Meeting, to concert the ways and
means of bringing this happy Revolution
about, the Assembly broke up.</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i> observing how well the Minds of the
People were dispos'd in favour of his Master,
wrote privately to him, to acquaint him with
the Success of the first Meeting, and advis'd
him to come, as if by chance, to <i>Lisbon</i>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
by his Presence he might encourage the Conspirators,
and at the same time get some Opportunity
of conferring with them. This
Man spent his whole time in negotiating this
grand Affair, yet did it so artfully, that no
one could suspect his having any farther Interest
in it, than his Concern for the Publick
Welfare. He seemingly doubted whether his
Master would ever enter into their Measures,
objecting his natural Aversion to any Undertaking
which was hazardous and requir'd
Application: then would he start some Difficulties,
which were of no other use but to
destroy all Suspicion of his having any Understanding
with his Master, and were so far
from being weighty enough to discourage
them, that they rather serv'd to excite their
Ardour.</p>

<p>Upon the Advice given by <i>Pinto</i>, the Duke
left <i>Villa-viciosa</i>, and came to <i>Almada</i>, a Castle
near <i>Lisbon</i>, on pretence of visiting it as he
had done the other Fortifications of that
Kingdom. His Equipage was so magnificent,
and he had with him such a number of the
Nobility and Gentry, as well as of Officers,
that he looked more like a King going to take
possession of a Kingdom, than like the Governour
of a Province, who was viewing the
Places and Forts under his Jurisdiction: he
was so near <i>Lisbon</i>, that he was under an
obligation of going to pay his Devoirs to the
Vice-Queen. As soon as he enter'd the Palace-yard,
he found the Avenues crowded
with infinite numbers of People, who press'd
forward to see him pass along; and all the
Nobility came to wait upon him, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
accompany him to the Vice-Queen's. It was
a general Holiday throughout the City, and
so great was the Joy of the People, that
there seem'd only a Herald wanting to proclaim
him King, or Resolution enough in
himself to put the Crown upon his Head.</p>

<p>But the Duke was too prudent to trust to
the uncertain Sallies of an inconstant People.
He knew what a vast difference there was between
their vain Shouts, and that Steddiness
which is necessary to support so great an
Enterprize. Therefore after having paid his
respects to the Vice-Queen, and taken leave
of her, he return'd to <i>Almada</i>, without so
much as going to <i>Braganza-House</i>, or passing
thro the City, lest he should encrease the
Jealousy of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who already seem'd
very uneasy at the Affection which the People
had so unanimously express'd for the
Duke.</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i> took care to make his Friends observe
the unnecessary Caution which his Master
us'd, and that therefore they ought not
to neglect this Opportunity, which his Stay
at <i>Almada</i> afforded them, to wait upon that
Prince, and to persuade, nay, as tho it were
to force him to accept the Crown. The Conspirators
thought the Counsel good, and deputed
him to the Duke to obtain an Audience.
He granted them one, but upon condition
there should come three of the Conspirators
only, not thinking it safe to explain himself
before a greater Number.</p>

<p><i>Miguel d'Almeida</i>, <i>Antonio d'Almada</i>, and
<i>Pedro Mendoza</i>, were the three Persons pitched
upon; who coming by night to the Prince's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and being introduc'd into his Chamber, <i>d'Almada</i>,
who was their Spokesman, represented
in few words the present unhappy State of
<i>Portugal</i>, whose Natives, of what Quality or
Condition soever, had suffer'd so much from
the unjust and cruel <i>Castilians</i>: That the
Duke himself was as much, if not more expos'd
than any other to their Treachery;
that he was too discerning not to perceive
that <i>d'Olivarez</i>'s Aim was his Ruin, and that
there was no other Place of Refuge but the
Throne; for the restoring him to which, he
had Orders to offer him the Services of a
considerable Number of People of the first
Quality, who would willingly expose their
Lives, and sacrifice their Fortunes for his
sake, and to revenge themselves upon the oppressing
<i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>He afterwards told them, that the Times
of <i>Charles</i> V. and <i>Philip</i> II. were no more,
when <i>Spain</i> held the Ballance of <i>Europe</i> in her
hand, and gave the neighbouring Nations
Laws: That this Monarchy, which had been
once so formidable, could scarce now preserve
its antient Territories; that the <i>French</i>
and <i>Dutch</i> not only wag'd War against them,
but often overcame 'em; that <i>Catalonia</i> itself
employ'd the greatest part of their Forces;
that they scarce had an Army on foot, the
Treasury was exhausted, and that the Kingdom
was governed by a weak Prince, who
was himself sway'd by a Minister, abhor'd by
the whole Nation.</p>

<p>He then observ'd what foreign Protection
and Alliances they might depend on, and be
assur'd of; most of the Princes of <i>Europe</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
were profess'd Enemies to the House of <i>Austria</i>;
the Encouragement <i>Holland</i> and <i>Catalonia</i>
had met with, sufficiently shew'd what
might be expected from that able<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Statesman,
whose mighty Genius seem'd wholly bent upon
the Destruction of the <i>Spanish</i> King; that
the Sea was now open, and he might have
free Communication with whom he pleas'd;
that there were scarce any <i>Spanish</i> Garisons
left in <i>Portugal</i>, they having been drawn out
to serve in <i>Catalonia</i>; that there could never
be a more favourable Opportunity of asserting
his Right and Title to the Crown, of
securing his Life, his Fortune, and his Liberty,
which were at stake, and of delivering
his Country from Slavery and Oppression.</p>

<p>We may easily imagine, that there was
nothing in this Speech which could displease
the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>; however, unwilling
to let them see his Heart, he answer'd the
Deputies in such a manner, as could neither
lessen, or encrease their Hopes. He told
them, that he was but too sensible of the
Miseries to which <i>Portugal</i> was reduc'd by
the <i>Castilians</i>, nor could he think himself secure
from their Treachery; that he very
much commended the Zeal which they shew'd
for the Welfare of their Country, and was
in an especial manner oblig'd to them for the
Affection which they bore him in particular;
that notwithstanding what they had represented,
he fear'd that matters were not ripe
for so dangerous an Enterprize, whose Consequence,
should they not bring it to a happy
Period, would prove so fatal to them
all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Having return'd this Answer, (for a more
positive one he would not return) he caress'd
the Deputies, and thank'd them in so obliging
a manner, that they left him, well satisfy'd
that their Message was gratefully receiv'd;
but at the same time persuaded, that
the Prince would be no farther concerned in
their Design, than giving his content to the
Execution of it, as soon as their Plot should
be ripe.</p>

<p>After their Departure, the Duke confer'd
with <i>Pinto</i> about the new Measures which
they must take, and then return'd to <i>Villa-viciosa</i>;
but not with that inward Satisfaction
of Mind which he had hitherto enjoy'd, but
with a Restlessness of Thought, the too common
Companion of Princes.</p>

<p>As soon as he arriv'd, he communicated
those Proportions, which had been made
him, to the Dutchess his Wife. She was of
a <i>Castilian</i> Family, Sister to the Duke of <i>Medina
Sidonia</i>, a Grandee of <i>Spain</i>, and Governor
of <i>Andalusia</i>. During her Childhood, her
Mind was great and heroick, and as she
grew up, became passionately fond of Honour
and Glory. The Duke, her Father, who
perceived this natural Inclination of hers,
took care to cultivate it betimes, and gave
the Care of her Education to Persons who
would swell her Breast with<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Ambition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
represent it as the chiefest Virtue of Princes.
She apply'd herself betimes to the Study of
the different Tempers and Inclinations of
Mankind, and would by the Looks of a Person
judge of his Heart; so that the most
dissembling Courtier could scarce hide his
Thoughts from her discerning Eye. She
neither wanted Courage to undertake, nor
Conduct to carry on the most difficult things,
provided their End was glorious and honourable.
Her Actions were free and easy, and
at the same time noble and majestick; her
Air at once inspir'd Love, and commanded
Respect. She took the <i>Portuguese</i> Air with
so much ease, that it seem'd natural to her.
She made it her chief Study to deserve the
Love and Esteem of her Husband; nor could
the Austerity of her Life, a solid Devotion,
and a perfect Complaisance to all his Actions,
fail of doing it. She neglected all those
Pleasures, which Persons of her Age and
Quality usually relish; and the greatest part
of her time was employ'd in Studies, which
might adorn her Mind, and improve her Understanding.</p>

<p>The Duke thought himself compleatly
happy in the possession of so accomplish'd a
Lady; his Love could scarce be parallel'd,
and his Confidence in her was entire: He
never undertook any thing without her Advice,
nor would he engage himself any farther
in a matter of such consequence, without
first consulting with her. He therefore
shew'd her the Scheme of the Revolution;
the Names of the Conspirators, and acquainted
her with what had pass'd as well in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Assembly held at <i>Lisbon</i>, as in the Conference
he had had with them at <i>Almada</i>, and
the Warmth which every one had shown upon
this occasion. He told her, That the
Expedition of <i>Catalonia</i> had so incens'd the
Nobility, that they were all resolv'd to revolt,
rather than to leave their native Country;
he dreaded, that if he should refuse to
lead them on, they would forsake him, and
chuse themselves another Leader. Yet he
confess'd, that the Greatness of the Danger
made him dread the Event; that whilst he
view'd the Throne at a distance, the flattering
Idea of Royalty was most agreeable to
his Mind, but that now having a nearer
Prospect of it, and of the intervening Obstacles,
he was startled; nor could he calmly
behold those Dangers into which he must inevitably
plunge himself and his whole Family,
in case of a Discovery: That the People,
on whom they must chiefly depend for
the Success, were inconstant, and disheartned
by the least Difficulty: That the Number
of Nobility and Gentry which he had
on his side, was not sufficient, unless supported
by the Grandees of the Kingdom;
who doubtless, jealous of his Fortune, would
oppose it, as not being able to submit to the
Government of one, whom they had all along
look'd upon as their Equal. That these Considerations,
as well as the little Dependance
he could make on foreign Assistance, overrul'd
his Ambition, and made him forget
the hopes of reigning. But the Dutchess,
whose Soul was truly great, and Ambition
her ruling Passion, immediately declar'd herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
in favour of the Conspiracy. She ask'd
the Duke, "Whether in case the <i>Portuguese</i>,
accepting his Denial, should resolve to
make themselves a Republick, he would side
with them, or with the King of <i>Spain</i>?"
"With his Countrymen undoubtedly, <i>he reply'd</i>;
for whose Liberty he would willingly
venture his Life." "And why can you
not do for your own sake, <i>answer'd she</i>,
what you would do as a Member of the
Commonwealth? The Throne belongs to
you, and should you perish in attempting
to recover it, your Fate would be glorious,
and rather to be envy'd than pity'd." After
this she urg'd "his undoubted Right to
the Crown; that <i>Portugal</i> was reduc'd to
such a miserable State by the <i>Castilians</i>,
that it was inconsistent with the Honour
of a Person of his Quality to be an idle
Looker-on; that his Children would reproach,
and their Posterity curse his Memory,
for neglecting so fair an Opportunity
of restoring them what they ought in
justice to have had." Then she represented
the difference between a Sovereign
and a Subject, and the pleasure of ruling,
instead of obeying in a servile manner. She
made him sensible, that it would be no such
difficult matter to re-possess himself of the
Crown; that tho he could not hope for foreign
Assistance, yet were the <i>Portuguese</i> of
themselves able to drive the <i>Spaniards</i> out of
their Country, especially at such a favourable
Juncture as this. In short, so great was
her persuasive Art, that she prevailed upon
the Duke to accept the Offer made him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
at the same time confess'd his Prudence, in
letting the Number of the Conspirators encrease
before he join'd with them; nor would
she advise him to appear openly in it, till the
Plot was ripe.</p>

<p>Mean while the Court of <i>Spain</i> grew very
jealous or him. Those extraordinary Marks
of Joy, which the <i>Lisbonites</i> had shewn at his
coming thither, had very much alarm'd <i>d'Olivarez</i>.
It was also whisper'd about, that
there were nightly Meetings and secret Assemblies
held at <i>Lisbon</i>: So impossible it is,
that a Business of such a consequence should
be wholly conceal'd.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Octob. 20.<br />
1640.</i></div>

<p>Upon this several Councils were held at
<i>Madrid</i>, in which it was resolv'd, that the
only way to prevent the <i>Portuguese</i> from revolting,
was by taking from them their Leader,
in favour of whom it was suppos'd they
intended to revolt. Wherefore <i>d'Olivarez</i>
immediately dispatch'd a Courier to the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i>, to acquaint him, that the King
desir'd to be inform'd, by his own mouth,
of the Strength of every Fort and Citadel,
the Condition of the Sea-Ports, and what
Garisons were plac'd in each of them: to
this he added, that his Friends at Court
were overjoy'd at the thoughts of seeing him
so soon, and that every one of them were
preparing to receive him with the Respect
due to his Quality and Deserts.</p>

<p>This News thunder-struck the unhappy
Prince; he was well assur'd, that since so
many Pretences were made use of to get him
into <i>Spain</i>, his Destruction was resolv'd on,
and nothing less than his Life could satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
them. They had left off Caresses and Invitations,
and had now sent positive Orders,
which either must be obey'd, or probably
open Force would be made use of. He concluded,
that he was betray'd. Such is the
Fear of those, whose Thoughts are taken up
with great Designs, and who always imagine
that the inquisitive World is prying into their
Actions, and observing all their Steps. Thus
did the Duke, whose Conduct had been always
greater than his Courage, dread that
he had plung'd himself into inevitable Destruction.</p>

<p>But to gain time enough to give the Conspirators
notice of his Danger, by the Advice
of the Dutchess, he sent a Gentleman,
whose Capacity and Fidelity he was before
assur'd of, to the Court of <i>Madrid</i>, to assure
the <i>Spanish</i> Minister, that he would suddenly
wait on the King; but had at the same time
given him private Orders to find out all the
Pretences imaginable for the delaying his
Journey, hoping in the mean time to bring
the Conspiracy to Ripeness, and thereby to
shelter himself from the impending Storm.</p>

<p>As soon as this Gentleman arriv'd at <i>Madrid</i>,
he assur'd the King and the Duke <i>d'Olivarez</i>,
that his Master follow'd him. To
make his Story the more plausible, he took a
large House, which he furnish'd very sumptuously,
then hir'd a considerable Number of
Servants, to whom he before-hand gave Liveries.
In short, he spar'd no Cost to persuade
the <i>Spaniards</i> that his Master would be
in a very little time at Court, and that he intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to appear with an Equipage suitable
to his Birth.</p>

<p>Some days after he pretended to have receiv'd
Advice that his Master was fallen sick.
When this Pretence was grown stale, he
presented a Memorial to <i>d'Olivarez</i>, in which
he desir'd that his Master's Precedence in the
Court might be adjusted. He did not in the
least question but that this would gain a considerable
time, hoping that the Grandees, by
maintaining their Rights, would oppose his
Claims. But these Delays beginning to be
suspected, the first Minister had the thing
soon decided, and always in favour of the
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>; so earnestly did he desire
to see him once out of <i>Portugal</i>, and to have
him safe at <i>Madrid</i>.</p>

<p>The Conspirators no sooner heard of the
Orders which the Duke had receiv'd, but
fearing that he might obey them, deputed
<i>Mendoza</i> to know what he intended to do,
and to engage him firmly, if possible, to their
Party. This Gentleman was chosen preferably
to any other, because he was Governor
of a Town near <i>Villa-viciosa</i>; so that he
could hide the real Intent of his Journey
from the <i>Spaniards</i>, under the specious Pretence
of Business. He did not dare to go
directly to the Prince's House, but took an
opportunity of meeting him in a Forest one
morning as he was hunting; they retir'd together
into the thickest part of the Wood,
where <i>Mendoza</i> shew'd him what Danger he
expos'd himself to, by going to a place
where all were his Enemies: That by this
inconsiderate Action the Hopes of the Nobility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
as well as of the People, were utterly
destroy'd: That a sufficient Number of
Gentlemen, who were as able to serve him,
as they were willing to do it, or to sacrifice
their Lives for his sake, only waited for his
Consent to declare themselves in his favour:
That now was the very Crisis of his Fate,
and that he must this instant resolve to be
<i>Cæsar</i> or nothing: That the Business would
admit of no longer Delay, lest the Secret being
divulg'd, their Designs should prove abortive.
The Duke, convinc'd of the Truth
of what was said to him, told him that he
was of his mind, and that he might assure
his Friends, that as soon as their Plot should
be ripe, he would put himself at the head
of them.</p>

<p>This Conference ended, <i>Mendoza</i> immediately
return'd home, for fear of being suspected,
and wrote to some of the Conspirators
that he had been hunting; "We had
almost, <i>continued he</i>, lost our Game in the
Pursuit, but at last the Day prov'd a Day
of good Sport." Some few Days after <i>Mendoza</i>
return'd to <i>Lisbon</i>, and acquainted <i>Pinto</i>
that his Master wanted him, who set out as
soon as they had together drawn out a shorter
Scheme to proceed upon. Coming to <i>Villa-viciosa</i>,
the first thing he acquainted the Duke
with, was the Difference which had lately happen'd
at the Court of <i>Lisbon</i>, the Vice-Queen
loudly complaining of the haughty Pride and
Insolence of <i>Vasconcellos</i>; nor could she any
longer bear that all Business should be transacted
by him, whilst she enjoy'd an empty
Title, without any the least Authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
What made her Complaints the juster, was,
that she was really a deferring Princess, and
capable of discharging the Trust which was
committed to her Secretary. But it was the
Greatness of her Genius, and her other extraordinary
Deserts, which made the Court
of <i>Spain</i> unwilling to let her have a greater
share in the Government. <i>Pinto</i> observ'd,
that this Difference could never have happen'd
in a better time, seeing that the Ministers
of <i>Spain</i> being taken up with this Business,
would not be at leisure to pry into
his Actions, or to observe the Steps he should
take.</p>

<p>The Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, since <i>Mendoza</i>'s
Departure, was fallen into his wonted Irresolution,
and the nearer the Business came to
a Crisis, the more he dreaded the Event:
<i>Pinto</i> made use of all his Rhetorick to excite
his Master's Courage, and to draw him into
his former Resolution. Nay, to his Persuasions
he added Threatnings; he told him, in
spite of himself, the Conspirators would proclaim
him King, and what Dangers must he
run then, when the Crown should be fix'd
upon his Head, at a time when, only for
want of necessary Preparation, he was not
capable of preserving it. The Dutchess
join'd with this faithful Servant, and convinc'd
the Duke of the Baseness of preferring
Life to Honour: he, charm'd with her Courage,
yet asham'd to see it greater than his
own, yielded to their Persuasions.</p>

<p>Mean while, the Gentleman whom he had
sent to <i>Madrid</i>, wrote daily to let him know,
that he could no longer defer his Journey on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
any pretence whatsoever, and that <i>Olivarez</i>
refus'd to hear the Excuses which he would
have made. The Duke, to gain a little longer
time, order'd the Gentleman to acquaint
the <i>Spanish</i> Minister, that he had long since
been at <i>Madrid</i>, had he had Money enough
to defray the Expence of his Journey, and to
appear at Court in a manner suitable to his
Quality: That as soon as he could receive a
sufficient Sum, he would immediately set out.</p>

<p>This Business dispatch'd, he consulted
with the Dutchess and <i>Pinto</i> about the properest
Means of executing their Design: several
were propos'd, but at last this was
agreed upon, That the Plot must break out
at <i>Lisbon</i>, whose Example might have a good
effect upon the other Towns and Cities of
the Kingdom: That the same Day wherein
he was proclaim'd King in the Metropolis,
he should be also proclaim'd in every Place
which was under his Dependance; nay, in
every Borough and Village, of which any of
the Conspirators were the leading Men, they
should raise the People, so that one half of
the Kingdom being up, the other of course
would fall into their Measures, and the few
remaining <i>Spaniards</i> would not know on
which side to turn their Arms. His own
Regiment he should quarter in <i>Elvas</i>, whose
Governour was wholly in his Interest. That
as for the manner of their making themselves
Masters of <i>Lisbon</i>, Time and Opportunity
would be their best Counsellors;
however, the Duke's Opinion was, that
they should seize the Palace in the first
place, so that by securing the Vice-Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and the <i>Spaniards</i> of Note, they would be
like so many Hostages in their hands, for the
Behaviour of the Governour and Garison of
the Citadel, who otherwise might very much
annoy 'em when they were Masters of the
Town. After this, the Duke having assur'd
<i>Pinto</i>, that notwithstanding any Change of
Fortune, he should still have the same place
in his Affection; he sent him to <i>Lisbon</i> with
two Letters of Trust, one for <i>Almeida</i>, the
other for <i>Mendoza</i>; wherein he conjur'd 'em
to continue faithful to their Promises, and
resolutely and courageously to finish what
they had begun.</p>

<p>As soon as he arriv'd at <i>Lisbon</i>, he deliver'd
his Letters to <i>Almeida</i> and <i>Mendoza</i>,
who instantly sent for <i>Lemos</i> and <i>Coreo</i>, whom
<i>Pinto</i> had long since engag'd in the Interest of
his Master. These were two rich Citizens,
who had gone thro all the Offices of the
City, and had the People of it very much at
their command; as they still carry'd on their
Trade, there were a vast Number of poor
People daily employ'd by 'em, and whose
Hatred to the <i>Spaniards</i> they had still taken
care to encrease, by insinuating that there
were new Taxes to be laid upon several
things at the beginning of the next Year.
When they observ'd any one of a fiery Temper,
they would take care to discharge him,
on pretence that the <i>Castilians</i> had utterly
ruin'd their Trade, and that they were no
longer able to employ them; but their Aim
was to reduce them to Poverty and Want,
insomuch that Necessity should oblige them
to revolt: but still would they extend their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Charity towards them, that they might always
have them at their service. Besides
this, they had engag'd some of the ablest
Merchants and Tradesmen in every part of
<i>Lisbon</i>, and promis'd, that if the Conspirators
would give 'em warning over night of the
Hour they intended to rise, punctually at
that time they would have half the City up
in Arms.</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i> being thus sure of the Citizens,
turn'd his Thoughts to the other Conspirators:
he advis'd them to be ready for the
Execution of their Plot upon the first notice
given them; that mean while he would have
them pretend they had some private Quarrel,
and engage their Friends to assist them, for
many, he observ'd, were not fit to be entrusted
with so important a Secret, and others
could not in cold Blood behold the
Dangers they must go thro, and yet both be
very serviceable when Matters were ripe, and
only their Swords wanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dec. 1.<br />
1640.</i></div>

<p>Finding every body firm in their Resolutions,
and impatient to revenge themselves
upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, he conferr'd with <i>Almeida</i>,
<i>Mendoza</i>, <i>Almada</i>, and <i>Mello</i>, who fix'd
upon Saturday, the first of <i>December</i>, for the
great, the important Day: Notice was immediately
given to the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>,
that he might cause himself to be proclaim'd
King the same day in the Province of <i>Alentejo</i>,
most part of which belong'd to him.
After which they agreed upon meeting once
more before the time.</p>

<p>On the Twenty-fifth of <i>November</i>, according
to their Agreement, they met at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<i>Braganza-House</i>, where mustering their Forces,
they found that they could depend upon
about One Hundred and Fifty Gentlemen,
(most of them Heads of Families) with their
Servants and Tenants, and about Two Hundred
substantial Citizens, who could bring
with them a considerable Number of inferior
Workmen.</p>

<p><i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Death was unanimously resolv'd
on, as a just Victim, and which would be
grateful to the People. Some urg'd, that the
Archbishop of <i>Braga</i> deserv'd the same Fate,
especially considering the Strength of his Genius,
and the Greatness of his Courage; for
it was not to be suppos'd that he would be
an idle Looker-on, but would probably be
more dangerous than the Secretary himself
could be, by raising all the <i>Spaniards</i> who
were in <i>Lisbon</i>, with their Creatures; and
that whilst they were busy in making themselves
Masters of the Palace, he, at the head
of his People, might fling himself into the
Citadel, or come to the assistance of the
Vice-Queen, to whose Service he was entirely
devoted; and that at such a time as
this, Pity was unseasonable, and Mercy dangerous.</p>

<p>These Considerations made the greatest
part of the Assembly consent to the Prelate's
Death; and he had shar'd <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Fate,
had not<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Don <i>Miguel d'Almeida</i> interpos'd.
He represented to the Conspirators, that the
Death of a Man of the Prelate's Character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and Station, would make them odious to the
People; that it would infallibly draw the
Hatred of the Clergy, and of the Inquisition
in particular, (a People who at this Juncture
were to be dreaded) upon the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>,
to whom they would not only give
the Names of Tyrant and Usurper, but
whom they would also excommunicate; that
the Prince himself would be sorely griev'd to
have the Day stain'd with so cruel an Action;
that he himself would engage to watch
him so closely on that Day, that he should
not have an Opportunity of doing any thing
which might be prejudicial to the common
Cause. In short, he urg'd so many things in
his behalf, that the Prelate's Life was granted,
the Assembly not being able to deny any
thing to so worthy an Advocate.</p>

<p>Nothing now remain'd but to regulate the
Order of the March and Attack, which was
agreed upon in this manner: They should
divide into four Companies, which should
enter the Palace by four different Ways; so
that all the Avenues to it being stopt, the
<i>Spaniards</i> might have no Communication with,
or be able to assist one another: That Don
<i>Miguel d'Almeida</i>, with his, should fall on the
<i>German</i> Guard, at the Entrance of the Palace:
That <i>Mello</i> Lord <i>Ranger</i>, his Brother,
and Don <i>Estevan d'Acugna</i>, should attack the
Guard, which was always set at a Place
call'd the <i>Fort</i>: That the Lord-Chamberlain
<i>Emanuel Saa</i>, <i>Teillo de Menezes</i>, and <i>Pinto</i>,
should enter <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Apartment, whom
they must immediately dispatch: That Don
<i>Antonio d'Almada</i>, <i>Mendoza</i>, Don <i>Carlos Norogna</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and <i>Antonio Salsaigni</i>, should seize the
Vice-Queen, and the <i>Spaniards</i> which were
with her, to serve for Hostages, in case of
need. Mean while, some of the Gentlemen,
with a few of the most reputable Citizens,
should proclaim Don <i>John</i>, Duke of <i>Braganza</i>,
King of <i>Portugal</i> throughout the City;
and that the People being rais'd by their Acclamations,
they should make use of them
to assist, wherever they found any Opposition.
After this they resolv'd to meet on
the first of <i>December</i> in the morning, some at
<i>Almeida</i>'s, some at <i>Almada</i>'s, and the rest at
<i>Mendoza</i>'s House, where every Man should
be furnish'd with necessary Arms.</p>

<p>While these things were transacting at <i>Lisbon</i>,
and that the Duke's Friends were using
all their Endeavours for his Re-establishment,
he receiv'd an Express from <i>Olivarez</i>, (who
grew very jealous of his Conduct) with positive
Orders to come immediately to <i>Madrid</i>;
and that he might have nothing to colour his
Delay, he remitted him a Bill upon the Royal
Treasury for Ten Thousand Ducats.</p>

<p>The Commands laid upon him were so
plain and positive, that the Duke could not
put off his Journey without justly encreasing
his Suspicion. He plainly foresaw, that if
he did not obey those Orders, the Court of
<i>Madrid</i> would take some such Measures as
might prove fatal to him, and wholly destroy
their Projection; he would not therefore refuse
to obey, but made part of his Houshold
immediately set out, and take the <i>Madrid</i>
Road. In the presence of the Courier he
gave several Orders relating to the Conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of those he left his Deputy-Governours, and
in all respects behav'd himself like a Man
who was going a long Journey. He dispatch'd
a Gentleman to the Vice-Queen, to
give her notice of his Departure, and wrote
to <i>Olivarez</i>, that he would be at <i>Madrid</i> in
eight Days time at farthest; and that he
might engage the Courier to report all these
things, he made him a considerable Present,
under pretence of rewarding him for his expeditious
Haste, in bringing him Letters from
the King, and his first Ministers. At the
same time he let the Conspirators know what
new Orders he had receiv'd from Court, that
they might see the Danger of deferring the
Execution of their Design; but they were
scarce in a Capacity of assisting him, an Accident
having happen'd, which had almost
broken all their Measures.</p>

<p>There was at <i>Lisbon</i> a Nobleman, who
on all Occasions had shewn an immortal Hatred
to the <i>Spanish</i> Government; he never
call'd them any thing but Tyrants and Usurpers,
and would openly rail at their unjust
Proceedings, but nothing anger'd him more
than the Expedition of <i>Catalonia</i>: <i>d'Almada</i>
having taken care to fall often into his Company,
thought there was not a truer-hearted
<i>Portuguese</i> in the whole Kingdom, and that no
one would more strenuously labour for their
Liberty. But oh Heaven! how great was
his Surprize! when having taken him aside,
and discover'd the whole Conspiracy to him,
this base, this cowardly Wretch, whose whole
Courage was plac'd in his Tongue, refus'd
to have any hand in the Business, or to engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
himself with the Conspirators, pretending
that their Plot had no solid Foundation:
Bold and adventrous where no Danger was,
but fearful and daunted as soon as it appear'd.
"Have you, <i>said he to</i> Almada, Forces enough
to undertake so great a thing? Where is
your Army to oppose the Troops of <i>Spain</i>,
who upon the first News of the Revolt
will enter the Kingdom? What Grandees
have you at your head? Can they furnish
you with Money sufficient to defray the
Expence of a Civil War? I fear, <i>continued
he</i>, that instead of revenging yourselves
on the <i>Spaniards</i>, and freeing <i>Portugal</i>
from Slavery, you will utterly ruin it,
by giving the <i>Spaniards</i> a specious Pretence
for doing what they have been so long
endeavouring at."</p>

<p><i>D'Almada</i>, who expected nothing less than
such an Answer, and being very much troubled
at his having entrusted the Secret to a
Man, who in all probability would betray it,
without replying drew his Sword, and coming
up to the other, his Eyes sparkling with
Rage; "Base Wretch, <i>said he</i>, by thy deceitful
Words thou hast drawn a Secret
from me, with which thou must take my
Life, or by the Loss of thine atone for thy
Treachery." The other, who had always
thought it safest to avoid the nearest Danger,
at the sight of <i>d'Almada</i>'s naked Sword,
promis'd to do any thing. He offer'd to sign
the Conspiracy, and found weighty Reasons
to destroy his former Objections; he swore
that he would bury the Secret in his Heart,
and endeavour'd all he could to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<i>Almada</i>, that it was neither want of Courage,
or Hatred to the <i>Spaniards</i>, which had at
first made him averse to what he had propos'd.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his Oaths and Promises,
<i>d'Almada</i> could not be thoroughly satisfy'd of
this Man's Fidelity; he took care, without
losing sight of him, to let the others know
what had happen'd. A general Consternation
immediately spread itself amongst them,
and they fear'd, that the Prospect of the
Danger which he must share, or the Hope of
a Reward, would make this Wretch betray
them. Upon this they resolv'd to defer the
Execution of their Project, and forc'd <i>Pinto</i>
to write to his Master, to put off his being
proclaim'd in his Country, till he should hear
further from them. But <i>Pinto</i>, who knew
how dangerous it was to defer such a thing,
tho but for a Day, at the same time sent him
another Letter, in which he desir'd him to
take no notice of his first, seeing that it was
only the Effect of a panick Fear, which had
seiz'd the Conspirators, and which would be
over long before the Express arriv'd.</p>

<p>Nor was this crafty Man at all deceiv'd;
for the next Day finding every thing still and
quiet, and the Person who caus'd the Alarm
making fresh Promises of Secrecy, they concluded
that either he had arm'd his Mind
with a generous Resolution of assisting them,
or was afraid of impeaching so many Persons
of Quality; and therefore they determin'd
to proceed to Execution on the appointed
Day. But another Adventure happen'd,
which disquieted 'em as much as the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>There were always in the Palace several
of the Conspirators, walking up and down
like Courtiers out of Place, whose Business
it was to observe what was done within;
but on the Evening of the last of <i>November</i>,
they came in a Fright to their Companions,
to tell them that <i>Vasconcellos</i> (by whose Death
they were to begin the mighty Work) was
just gone on board a Yacht, and had cross'd the
<i>Tagus</i>. Who but Conspirators would have
taken notice of so indifferent a thing? For a
thousand Reasons, in which they were not
concern'd, might have made him go on the other
side of the Water; but they immediately
concluded, that this artful Statesman, who
had always his Spies abroad, had discover'd
their Plot, and was about to bring into <i>Lisbon</i>
those Soldiers which were quarter'd in
the Villages on the other side of the River.
Death, in its most ghastly Shape, appear'd to
them, and they fancy'd that they already felt
the cruellest Torments which could be inflicted.
Some were resolving to fly into <i>Africa</i>,
others into <i>England</i>; and all of them
spent the first part of the Night in the greatest
Disquiet imaginable, between the Hopes
of Life and Fear of Death. But about the
middle of the Night their Apprehensions vanish'd;
for some who had been sauntring about
the Port, to endeavour to discover the
Secretary's Design, came and brought them
the welcome News, that <i>Vasconcellos</i> had been
only diverting himself upon the Water, and
that he was return'd, with the Musick playing
before him. A sudden Joy succeeded to
their Grief, and about an hour after, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
inform'd that every thing was quiet in the
Palace, and every body bury'd in a profound
Sleep, they return'd home to enjoy a little
Rest; that they might be fitter for the Morning's
Work.</p>

<p>It was very late, or rather very early,
when they parted, and within some few hours
of their appointed time, and yet an Accident
happen'd within those few hours, which had
almost betray'd them; so dangerous and uncertain
are Enterprizes of this nature, whilst
there are Men, whom Hopes of Gain, or Fear
of Punishment, can work upon to betray their
Fellows. Don <i>George Mello</i>, Brother to the
Lord <i>Ranger</i>, lodg'd at a Relation's House,
in the furthest Suburbs of <i>Lisbon</i>. This Gentleman
thought, that now the time was come
in which the Conspiracy would break out,
and there was no necessity of hiding it any
longer from this Relation, whom he had reason
to believe was his Friend, as also one that
might be serviceable to them, and who otherwise
would for ever reproach him with having
distrusted him as one not true to the Interest of
his Country. Wherefore as soon as he came
home, he went into his Chamber, and there reveal'd
the Secret, desiring him to join in the
Enterprize with so many Persons of Quality,
and to behave himself as a <i>Portuguese</i> ought to
do upon such an occasion. The other, surpriz'd
at the Strangeness of this News, affected a
seeming Joy for the approaching Liberty of
his Country, thank'd <i>Mello</i> for the Confidence
he repos'd in him, and assur'd him,
that he accounted himself happy in having an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
opportunity of exposing his Life in so just
and glorious a Cause.</p>

<p>Upon this <i>Mello</i> retir'd to his Chamber,
to lay himself down to sleep, but scarce was
he got thither, when he began seriously to
reflect upon what he had been doing, and
could not but think himself guilty of a very
inconsiderate Action, in putting the Lives of
so many Persons of Quality in the power of
one, of whose Principles he was not overwell
assur'd; then began he to fancy, that
he had observ'd something of Fear in the
Countenance of the Person, at the time when
he was advising him to share the Danger of
the Undertaking.</p>

<p>Full of these Reflections, he could not
lay him down to rest, but was walking in
great Disorder about his Chamber, when he
thought he over-heard a kind of whispering
Noise. Opening his Window softly, to see
if any body was in the Street, he could perceive
a Servant holding his Relation's Horse,
and himself ready to mount. Enrag'd at
this, he snatch'd his Sword, and hastening
down stairs, seiz'd his Kinsman, and ask'd
him whither he was going at this unseasonable
time. The other would have forg'd an
Excuse, and was hammering out a Lye, but
<i>Mello</i> holding his Point to his Breast, threaten'd
to kill him, if he did not immediately
go in again; then order'd he the Keys of
the House to be brought him, and having
fasten'd all the Doors himself, he retir'd with
his Kinsman, nor would he lose sight of him
till it was time to go to the Rendevouz, to
which he carried him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>But now the Morning dawn'd, that was
to decide whether the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>
should be the King and Deliverer of his
Country, or be accounted a Rebel and Traitor.</p>

<p>Betimes in the Morning the Conspirators
met at the appointed Places, where they were
to be furnish'd with Arms. They all appear'd
with so much Resolution and Courage,
that they rather seem'd marching to a
certain Victory, than to an uncertain Enterprize.
But what is very much to be admir'd
at, is, that amongst such a Number of Nobility,
Gentry, Citizens, nay Priests, not one
should falsify his Word, or break his Promise,
tho their Interests in the Event were
very different; but they all seem'd as impatient
for the important Moment, as if each
there had been the Contriver of the Scheme,
or at the Head of the Enterprize; or rather,
as if the Crown was to have been the Reward
of each individual Man's Labour. Several
Ladies also made themselves famous on
that Day. But the noble Behaviour of Donna
<i>Philippa de Villenes</i> ought never to be forgotten,
who with her own hands arm'd both
her Sons; and giving them their Swords,
"Go, my Children, <i>said she</i>, put an end to
a Tyrant's Power, revenge yourselves on
your Enemies, free your Country, and be
assur'd, that if Success does not crown
your Undertaking, your Mother never will
live to see the cruel Fate of so many brave
and deserving Patriots."</p>

<p>Every one being arm'd, they made the best
of their way towards the Palace, most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
them in Litters, that they might conceal
their Number and their Arms. There they
divided into four Companies, and waited
with impatience till the Palace-Clock struck
Eight; that, and the firing of a Pistol, being
the appointed Signal. Never did time seem
so long; they fear'd that their being at that
Place so early, and in such a Number, might
make the Secretary jealous of their Design:
but at last the long-expected Hour struck,
and <i>Pinto</i> firing a Pistol, they rush'd forward
to execute their bold Design.</p>

<p>Don <i>Miguel d'Almeida</i>, with those that accompany'd
him, fell upon the <i>German</i> Guard,
who were so far from expecting any Attack,
that they were sitting very carelessly, few of
them having their Arms in hand; so that
they were cut to pieces, without scarce making
any resistance.</p>

<p>The Lord <i>Ranger</i>, with his Brother <i>Mello</i>,
and Don <i>Estevan d'Acugna</i>, fell on the <i>Spaniards</i>
who kept Guard at a Place before the
Palace, call'd the <i>Fort</i>. These Nobles, followed
by most of the Citizens who were engag'd
in the Conspiracy, fell upon the <i>Castilians</i>
Sword in hand, and fought most resolutely;
but no one behav'd himself more
bravely than one of the City Priests: this
Reverend Man, with a Crucifix in one hand,
and a Sword in the other, appear'd at the
head of his Party, and encourag'd the People,
both by his Words and his Example, to
cut their Enemies in pieces. The <i>Spaniards</i>,
aw'd at the sight of so religious an Object,
neither durst offend him, nor defend themselves,
but fled before him. In short, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
some small Resistance, the Officer of the
Guard, willing to save his own Life, was
forc'd to cry out with the rest, <i>Long live the
Duke of</i> Braganza, <i>King of</i> Portugal!</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i> having forced his way into the Palace,
march'd at the head of those, who were
to enter <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Apartment, so undauntedly,
and with so little concern, that meeting
with an Acquaintance, who, surpriz'd
and frighted, ask'd him, whither he was going
with such a Number of arm'd Men, and
what they design'd to do; "Nothing, <i>said
he smiling</i>, but change our Master, rid you
of a Tyrant, and give <i>Portugal</i> their rightful
King."</p>

<p>Entring the Secretary's Apartment, the
first Person they met with was the<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> <i>Civil
Corregidor</i>; who, thinking that the Noise he
heard proceeded from some private Quarrel,
would have interpos'd his Authority, but
hearing a Cry of <i>Long live the Duke of</i> Braganza,
<i>&amp;c.</i> thought he was in honour oblig'd
to cry out <i>Long live the King of</i> Spain <i>and</i>
Portugal: but he lost his Life for his ill-tim'd
Loyalty, one of the Conspirators immediately
shooting him thro the Head.</p>

<p><i>Antonio Correa</i>, first Clerk of the Secretary's
Office, ran out to know the Occasion of this
Tumult. This was the Man who was employ'd
in oppressing the People, and who, after
the Example of his Master, treated the
Nobility of the Kingdom with Scorn and
Contempt; therefore as soon as he appear'd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Don <i>Antonio de Menezes</i> plung'd his Sword
into his Bosom. But the Blow not ending
either his Life or Pride, and thinking
that they had mistaken him, he turn'd
towards <i>Menezes</i>, his Eyes sparkling with
Rage and Indignation, and, in a passionate
manner, cry'd out, <i>Villain! darest thou
strike me?</i> But <i>Menezes</i>, without answering,
redoubled his Blows; and the other, having
receiv'd four or five Stabs, fell down: However,
none of the Wounds prov'd mortal,
and he escap'd at that time, to lose his Life
afterwards in an ignominious manner, by
the hands of the common Hangman.</p>

<p>This Business had stop'd the Conspirators,
but as soon as <i>Correa</i> fell, they all rush'd
forwards towards <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Apartment.
There was with him, at that time, Don
<i>Garcez Palleia</i>, a Captain of Foot; who seeing
so many arm'd Men, immediately concluded,
that their Design was to butcher the
Secretary. And altho' he was under no
manner of Obligation to that Minister, yet
he thought himself in honour oblig'd to lend
him what Assistance he could; wherefore
standing at the Door, with his Sword in
hand, he barr'd that Passage: but one of
the Conspirators running him thro' the Arm,
and several, who were unwilling to give him
fair play, pressing forward, he was glad to
make his Escape, by leaping out of a Window.</p>

<p>Upon this all the Company, that was with
<i>Pinto</i>, enter'd the Chamber at once, and
sought <i>Vasconcellos</i>; they overturn'd the Bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and Tables, broke open the Trunks, and
every one was desirous of giving him the
first Blow; yet, spite of their Endeavour,
they could not find him, and they began to
fear that he had made his Escape: but at last
an old Maid-Servant being threaten'd with
Death, unless she would tell where her
Master was; and seeing the uplifted Swords,
pointed to a Press which was made within
the Wall, and in which they found the Secretary
bury'd under a heap of Papers.</p>

<p>So great was his fear of Death, which he
saw surrounding him on every side, that it
prevented his Speech. Don <i>Roderigo de Saa</i>,
Lord Chamberlain, was the Man who kill'd
him, by shooting him through the Head
with a Pistol; after which several of the
Conspirators stabb'd him, then threw him
out of the Window, crying, <i>Liberty! Liberty!
The Tyrant is dead! Long live Don</i> John
<i>King of</i> Portugal!</p>

<p>The Noise which all this had made, had
drawn a vast number of People to the Palace-Court,
who seeing the Secretary's Body
thrown out, shouted in a most joyful manner;
then rushing upon the Carcase, they
mangled it, every one being eager to give
him a Stab, thinking that, thro his sides,
they wounded Tyranny.</p>

<p>Thus perish'd <i>Miguel Vasconcellos</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>
by Birth, but by Inclination a <i>Spaniard</i>,
and an Enemy to his Country. He had an
excellent Genius for Business, was crafty,
politick, nor could any Man apply himself
closer to it than he did. He was always inventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
new ways of extorting Money from
the People, was unmerciful, inexorable, and
cruel, without the least regard to Friend or
Relation; so fix'd, that after he had taken
a Resolution, no one could byass his Temper;
and so harden'd, that he never knew
what the Stings of Conscience were. He
had a Soul that was not capable of relishing
any pleasure, but that of hoarding up Money;
so that he left vast Sums behind him,
part of which the People plunder'd, being
willing to repay themselves, in some measure,
that which had been extorted from
them.</p>

<p><i>Pinto</i>, without loss of time, march'd directly
to join the other Conspirators, who
were to make themselves Masters of the Palace,
and to seize the Vice-Queen; he found
that the Business was already done, and that
Success had every where crown'd their Undertakings.
Those who were appointed for
that Expedition, came directly up to her
Chamber, and the furious Mob, who follow'd
them, threatning to set her Apartment
on fire, if the Door was not immediately
open'd; the Vice-Queen thinking
by her Presence to pacify the Nobility, and
awe the People, came out, attended by her
Maids of Honour, and the Archbishop of
<i>Braga</i>; and addressing herself to the chief
Conspirators, "I own, Gentlemen, <i>said she</i>,
that the Secretary justly deserv'd your
Hatred and Indignation; his Cruelty and
his haughty Insolence were intolerable,
nor can his Death be charg'd upon you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a Crime, since you have only deliver'd
yourselves from an oppressing Minister: But
cannot his Blood satisfy you? Or what
other Victim would you sacrifice to your
Resentment? Think seriously, that altho'
his illegal Conduct may excuse this Insurrection,
yet should you any longer continue
in Arms, Rebellion will be laid at
your doors, and you will put it out of my
power to make your Peace with the
King."</p>

<p>Don <i>Antonio de Menezes</i> answer'd, and assur'd
her, "That so many Persons of Quality
had not taken up Arms to murder a
Wretch, who ought to have lost his Life
by the hands of the common Hangman;
but that their Design was to restore the
Crown to the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, to whom
it lawfully belong'd, and which the King
of <i>Spain</i> had unjustly usurp'd; and that
they were all ready to sacrifice their Lives
in so glorious a Cause." She was about
to reply, and to interpose the King's Authority;
but <i>d'Almeida</i>, who fear'd that
such a Speech might have a dangerous effect
upon the People, or at least cool their Courages,
interrupted her, saying, "That <i>Portugal</i>
acknowledg'd no other King but the
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>." Upon which the People
shouted again, crying, <i>Long live Don</i>
John, <i>King of</i> Portugal!</p>

<p>The Vice-Queen believing that her Presence
might be of service in the City, and
have a good effect upon the People every
where, where the Conspirators were not present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was going in haste down stairs, but
Don <i>Carlos Norogna</i> stopp'd her, desiring that
she would retire to her own Apartment, assuring
her that she should be treated with
as much Respect as if she still had the supreme
Command in the Kingdom; but told
her that it would be dangerous for so great
a Princess to expose herself to the Insults of
a furious People, who were jealous of their
Liberties, and enflam'd with Thirst of Revenge.
The Queen easily understood the
meaning of his words, and found that she
was their Prisoner. Enrag'd at this, "And
what can the People do to me?" <i>cry'd she</i>.
"Nothing, Madam, <i>reply'd</i> Norogna <i>in a
passion</i>, but fling your Highness out of the
Window."</p>

<p>The Archbishop of <i>Braga</i> hearing this Answer,
grew furious, and snatching a Sword
from one of the Soldiers who stood next him,
he flew towards <i>Norogna</i>, resolving to revenge
the Vice-Queen, and had certainly met with
Death, the just Reward of his Rashness,
had not Don <i>Miguel d'Almeida</i> laid hold of
him, and embracing him, begg'd him to consider
what Danger he expos'd himself to,
telling him that he was already hated enough
by the Conspirators; nor had he found it an
easy Task to obtain a Promise of them that
they would spare his Life, why then would
he urge them by an Action, which would not
only be unprofitable to his Cause, but which
also so highly misbecame his Character. The
Prelate, convinc'd of the Truth of what his
Friend said, was obliged to dissemble his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Anger; however, he hoped that he should
meet with some favourable Opportunity of
revenging himself on <i>Norogna</i>, and doing
something for the service of <i>Spain</i>, to whose
Interest he was entirely devoted.</p>

<p>The rest of the <i>Spaniards</i> who were in the
Palace, were made Prisoners by the other
Conspirators: Amongst these were the Marquiss
of <i>Puebla</i>, Major-Domo to the Vice-Queen,
and elder Brother to the Marquiss
<i>de Leganez</i>; Don <i>Didaco Cardenas</i>, Lieutenant-General
of the Cavalry; Don <i>Ferdinand
de Castro</i>, Comptroller of the Navy-Office;
the Marquiss <i>de Baynetto</i>, an <i>Italian</i>, Gentleman-Usher
to the Vice-Queen: with some
Sea-Officers, who lay on shore, and whose
Ships were in the Harbour. All this was
done as regularly and as quietly, as if they
had been taken up by an Order from the
King of <i>Spain</i>, nobody stirring to their Assistance,
and they not being able to defend
themselves, most of them having been seiz'd
in their Beds.</p>

<p>This done, Don <i>Antonio de Salsaigni</i>, follow'd
by a Crowd of Friends, and an innumerable
Multitude of People, went up into the Hall,
where the Court of Justice was then sitting,
and in an elegant Speech laid before them the
present Happiness of <i>Portugal</i>, who had restor'd
their own lawful King; he told them,
that Tyranny was now no more, and that the
Laws, which had been long slighted and neglected,
should henceforward take their regular
Course. This Speech was applauded by the
whole Court, and they chang'd the Title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
their Decrees, which they no longer made
in the Name of the King of <i>Spain</i>, but in
the Name of Don <i>John</i>, King of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p>Whilst <i>Salsaigni</i> was thus persuading the
high Court of Justice to adhere to the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i>'s Interest, Don <i>Gaston Coutingno</i>
was taking out of Prison those who had been
thrown into it by the Cruelty of the <i>Spanish</i>
Minister. These unhappy Wretches, who
had all along been persuaded, that they
should end their Lives in their dismal Dungeons,
unless taken out to be led to a cruel
Death; seeing themselves now at liberty,
and their Country in a fair way of being
freed, and resolving to suffer any thing, rather
than to return to their dark Prisons,
form'd a Body no less formidable than that
of the Conspirators, and who were as fully
resolv'd to set the Duke of <i>Braganza</i> on the
Throne.</p>

<p>But in the midst of this general Joy, <i>Pinto</i>,
with the rest of the Leaders, were under
great Apprehensions: The <i>Spaniards</i> were yet
Masters of the Citadel, from whence they
could easily burn and destroy the Town;
besides which, the Port was open to the
<i>Spanish</i> Fleet: therefore thinking that they
had done nothing till they had taken that
Place, they went up to the Vice-Queen,
and desir'd her to sign a Warrant to the Governour,
by virtue of which he should be
oblig'd to give them possession of the Citadel.</p>

<p>She, far from granting what they ask'd,
upbraided them as Rebels and Traitors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with Indignation ask'd them, Whether they
had a mind to make her an Accomplice?
But <i>d'Almada</i>, who knew how dangerous it
was to leave the Enemies any longer in that
Fort, and being provok'd at the Vice-Queen's
Denial, his Eyes sparkling with
Rage, swore violently, that if she did not
sign the Warrant, he would forthwith put
every one of the <i>Spaniards</i> to death, whom
they had taken in the Palace.</p>

<p>The poor Princess, frightened with these
Threats, and unwilling to be the Occasion
of the Death of so many Persons of Quality,
was obliged to comply, thinking at the same
time that the Governour knew his Duty too
well, to obey an Order, which he might be
assur'd was sign'd by Compulsion; but she
was very much mistaken in her Conjecture,
for Don <i>Lewis del Campo</i>, the <i>Spanish</i> Governour,
was a Man of no Resolution at all,
and seeing the Conspirators coming arm'd towards
the Citadel, and all the People of the
Town following them, who threaten'd to
cut him and his Garison in pieces, unless he
immediately surrender'd, was glad to see the
Warrant, and have so fair an Excuse for his
Cowardice; wherefore he immediately obey'd
the Order, and gave up the Fort.</p>

<p>Proud of having dispatch'd their Business
so happily, the Conspirators forthwith deputed
<i>Mendoza</i> and the Lord <i>Ranger</i> to the
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>, to acquaint him with
their Success, and assure him, that nothing
was now wanting but the Presence of their
King, to compleat the Happiness of his Subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding their Message, his Presence
was not equally coveted by every body.
The Grandees of the Kingdom could not see
him rais'd to the Throne, without being inwardly
jealous of his Fortune; and those of
the Nobility, who were not let into the Secret,
refus'd as yet to declare themselves;
nay, some went so far as to assure the People,
that the Duke would never approve of
so rash an Action, and whose consequence
might be so fatal to them all. Those who
were in the <i>Spanish</i> Interest, were in a strange
Consternation, and did not dare so much as
stir abroad, lest they should be sacrific'd by
the People, whose Rage was not yet appeas'd:
In short, every body seem'd at an
uncertainty, and waited impatiently for the
Resolutions of the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>.</p>

<p>But his Friends, who were better acquainted
with his Intentions, still pursued what
they had so happily began, and assembled in
the Palace, to give the necessary Orders.
The Archbishop was unanimously chosen
President of the Council, and Lord-Lieutenant
of <i>Portugal</i> till the King's Arrival. He
would at first have refus'd the Office, declaring
that his opinion was, that they had
more need of a good General at their head,
than of a Man of his Character. However,
being press'd by the Assembly to accept the
Place, he consented to it, on condition that
he might have the Archbishop of <i>Braga</i> for
his Collegue; who, he said, was well acquainted
with the Business, and might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
very serviceable to him during the King's
Absence.</p>

<p>This cunning Prelate chose his Brother
Archbishop sooner than any other Man, well
knowing that if he did accept it, he made
himself an Accomplice in what he call'd Rebellion,
and would be accounted criminal by
the <i>Spanish</i> Minister: Besides which, he
would have only had the Title of one of the
Lord-Lieutenants, without any share of the
Power. But if, on the other hand, he refus'd
it, he should for ever put him out of
the King's Favour, and make him odious to
all the People, who henceforwards would look
on him as an open and profess'd Enemy to
his Country.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of <i>Braga</i> was very sensible
of the Snare which was laid for him, but
as he was wholly devoted to the Vice-Queen,
and firm to the <i>Spanish</i> Interest, he
refus'd having any thing to do with the Administration;
so that the whole Burden of
the publick Affairs fell upon the Archbishop
of <i>Lisbon</i>: to ease him of part of which, they
gave him for Assistants Don <i>Miguel d'Almeida</i>,
<i>Pedro Mendoza</i>, and Don <i>Antonio d'Almada</i>.</p>

<p>One of the first Orders which the new
Governour gave, was to seize upon the three
<i>Spanish</i> Galloons which were then in the
Harbour; upon which they arm'd a few
Barks, and in them went most part of the
<i>Lisbon</i> Youth, so desirous were they of shewing
their Affection to the King: but the
Galloons were taken without Resistance, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Officers, and the greatest part of the Ships
Crew, having been seiz'd in the Morning
ashore.</p>

<p>That very Evening Couriers were dispatch'd
to every Province, to exhort the People
to give thanks for the Recovery of their
Liberties, and the Restoration of the Duke
of <i>Braganza</i>; with Orders at the same time
to all Governours of Towns, and other Magistrates,
to have him proclaim'd King of
<i>Portugal</i>, and to take all the <i>Spaniards</i>, in
their respective Districts, into custody.</p>

<p>And now they began to prepare every
thing at <i>Lisbon</i> for the Reception of the new
King, and the Archbishop sent word to
the late Vice-Queen, that she would very
much oblige them, in leaving the Palace
where she was, for he thought the King
would want her Apartment, and that he
had prepar'd every thing for her Reception
at the Palace of <i>Xabregas</i>, which was at the
farther end of the Town. This Princess receiv'd
the Order with a scornful Look, and
without answering a word, obey'd it. She
went thro the Street, but without the usual
Train of Courtiers and Crowd of People;
there was only the Archbishop of <i>Braga</i> with
her, who still gave her manifest Tokens of
his Respect, even now when he expos'd his
Life by so doing.</p>

<p>Mean while the Duke of <i>Braganza</i> continued
in the cruel State of Uncertainty, sometimes
flattering himself with the most pleasing
Ideas which a lively Hope can form,
and sometimes under the most dismal Apprehensions

which frighten'd Fancy can suggest.
The Distance between <i>Villa-viciosa</i> and <i>Lisbon</i>
being thirty Leagues, he could not know
what pass'd in his behalf so soon as he could
have wish'd. All that he knew was, that
on this Day his Life and Fortune were at
stake. He had at first resolv'd to have himself
proclaim'd at the same time in all the
Towns which were under his Dependance;
but his mind chang'd, and he determin'd to
wait for the News of what had pass'd at
<i>Lisbon</i>, before he undertook any thing. There
still remain'd the Kingdom of <i>Algarva</i>, and
the Citadel of <i>Elvas</i>, to which he could retire,
in case his Party at <i>Lisbon</i> should fail;
nay, he thought he could clear himself of
having any hand in the Conspiracy, especially
at a time when the <i>Spaniards</i> would be glad
to believe him innocent.</p>

<p>He had planted several Couriers on the
Road to <i>Lisbon</i>, and thereby expected to have
an Account of what had pass'd betimes; but
he had waited with impatience all the Day,
and the greatest part of the Night, without
hearing any thing, and the next Morning
was already near at hand, when <i>Mello</i> and
<i>Mendoza</i>, who had rode post from <i>Lisbon</i>, arriv'd.
They threw themselves at the Duke's
feet, by which Action, as well as by the Joy
which appear'd in their Faces, the Success
of their Undertaking might be better read,
than it was possible for them to express.</p>

<p>They were about to give him an exact
Account of every thing, but the Duke, without
hearing a word of what they had to tell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
him, conducted them to the Dutchess's Apartment.
The two Noblemen saluted her
with the same Respect, as if she had actually
been upon the Throne; they assur'd her of
the Good-Wishes and Fidelity of her Subjects:
and to shew her that they acknowledg'd
her their Queen, they now gave her the Title
of <i>Majesty</i>, whereas the Kings and Queens of
<i>Portugal</i> had hitherto been always call'd their
<i>Highnesses</i>.</p>

<p>We may easily judge of what pass'd in
the Heart of this Royal Pair, if we consider
the Fears and Agitations which they were
before in, and to what Grandeur they were
now rais'd. Nothing but Shouts of Joy
were heard throughout the Palace, the happy
News soon spread, and the same Morning
the King was proclaim'd in all those Places,
where it should have been done the Day before;
<i>Mello</i> and <i>Alphonso</i> also had him proclaim'd
at <i>Elvas</i>. The People came in Crouds
to pay their Homage to the new King;
which, tho in a confus'd manner, was no
less agreeable to him, than what he afterwards
receiv'd in all the formal Pomp of Ceremony.</p>

<p>The King immediately set out for <i>Lisbon</i>,
with the same Equipage which had been
prepar'd for his setting out for <i>Madrid</i>. He
was accompany'd by the Marquiss <i>de Ferreira</i>,
a Relation of his; the Count <i>de Vimioso</i>;
and several other Persons of Quality, who
were come to wait upon him to the Capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Decem. 6.</i></div>

<p>The Queen he left at <i>Villa-viciosa</i>, knowing
that her Presence was necessary there, to
keep the Provinces in awe. Every where,
upon the Roads to <i>Lisbon</i>, they met with
infinite Numbers of People, who crouded
forwards to see the King; who had the satisfaction
every where of hearing the People
blessing him, and cursing the <i>Spaniards</i>. All
the Nobility, with the whole Court, and the
Magistrates of the City, met him at a great
distance from <i>Lisbon</i>, and he enter'd the
Town amidst the Acclamations of a joyful
People.</p>

<p>That Evening there were Illuminations
every where, and Fireworks in every publick
Place; each Citizen in particular had a
Bonfire before his door, which made a <i>Spaniard</i>
say, "The Duke of <i>Braganza</i> was a
happy Prince, who had got a whole Kingdom
for a Bonfire." Nor was it long indeed
before he was Master of the whole
Kingdom, every Town follow'd the Example
of their Capital, and seem'd as if they
had a Plot ripe for Execution. Fresh Couriers
every day arriv'd, who brought News
of Towns, and sometimes of whole Provinces,
which had driven the <i>Castilians</i> out, and
proclaim'd the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>. Nor were
many of the <i>Spanish</i> Governours more resolute
than the Commander of the Citadel of
<i>Lisbon</i>; and whether they wanted Soldiers,
Ammunition, or Courage, is uncertain, but
most of them surrender'd, without so much
as giving the <i>Portuguese</i> the trouble of firing
a Gun. In short, they fled the Kingdom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
like so many Criminals who had broke out of
Prison; each Man dreaded <i>Vasconcellos</i>'s Fate,
and trembled at the sight of an incens'd Multitude:
nor was there a <i>Spaniard</i> left in the
whole Kingdom, but those who were taken
into Custody, and all this in less than a Fortnight's
time.</p>

<p>Don <i>Ferdinand de la Cueva</i>, Commander of
the Citadel of <i>St. Juan</i>, at the Mouth of the
<i>Tagus</i>, was the only Man who offer'd to
make any resistance, and to preserve the
Place for the King his Master. The Garison
was wholly compos'd of <i>Spaniards</i>, the Officers
brave, and resolv'd to hold it out to
the last; and therefore, as soon as the <i>Portuguese</i>
approach'd them, made a vigorous Defence.
They were oblig'd to besiege it in
form; to that end they brought Cannon from
<i>Lisbon</i>, and open'd the Trenches before it,
which they carry'd as far as the Counterscarp,
spite of the Besieged's continual Fire, and
their frequent Sallies. But the King, who knew
that treating with the Commander would be
not only the safest, but the shortest way,
made him such advantageous Proposals, that
the Governour could not resist the Temptation;
but dazled with the Prospect of the
vast Sum which was offer'd, besides a Commandry
of the <i>Order of Christ</i>, and pretending
that his Garison was not strong enough
to hold out a Siege, he surrender'd upon
Terms, spite of the chief Officers, who refus'd
to sign the Capitulation.</p>

<p>This done, the King thought it best not
to defer his Coronation, that he might thereby
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
confirm his Royalty, and consecrate his
Majesty. The Ceremony was perform'd on
the Fifteenth of <i>December</i> with all the Magnificence
imaginable; the Duke <i>d'Aveiro</i>, the
Marquiss <i>de Villareal</i>, the Duke <i>de Carmino</i>,
his Son, the Count <i>de Monsano</i>, and all the
other Grandees of the Kingdom, being present.
The Archbishop of <i>Lisbon</i>, at the head
of all the Clergy of his Diocese, and accompany'd
by several other Bishops, met him at
the Door of the Cathedral; there he was solemnly
acknowledg'd by the States of the
Kingdom their Rightful and Lawful King:
after which every one of them took the Oath
of Allegiance.</p>

<p>Some few Days after the Coronation, the
Queen arriv'd at <i>Lisbon</i> with a sumptuous
Equipage and numerous Retinue. All the
Court went out of Town to meet her, and
she already had with her all the Officers of her
Houshold. The King himself met her at some
distance from the Town. This Prince omitted
nothing which might make her Entry appear
magnificent, and convince the People that he
believ'd she had very much contributed to
the placing the Crown upon his Head. Every
one observ'd, that notwithstanding her
Fortune was alter'd, yet was not the Queen
in the least chang'd, but behav'd herself as
majestically, as if she had been born to, and
was educated for the Possession of a Throne.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the Success of this great
Enterprize, as happily finish'd, as it was
prudently begun; which may be reckon'd a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sort of Miracle, considering the vast Number
of Persons, and the different Quality and Inclinations
of those who were let into the
Secret: Nor can it be accounted for, but
from the natural Hatred which the <i>Portuguese</i>
had to a <i>Spanish</i> Government; a Hatred!
which took its first Rise from the frequent
Wars which these neighbouring Nations waged
against one another, ever since they had
been Monarchies; as well as from their being
both concern'd in the Discovery of the
<i>Indies</i>, and the frequent Debates which they
had concerning their Commerce; these
at last grew into an inveterate Hatred,
which was now encreas'd by the Tyranny
of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>The News of the Revolution soon reach'd
the Court of <i>Spain</i>. <i>D'Olivarez</i> was almost
driven to Despair at the hearing it; he saw
his own Project miscarry, and Ruin threatning
his Country, which might have been easily
prevented, but could not now be remedy'd.
Nor had <i>Spain</i> any need of acquiring new
Enemies, the <i>French</i> and <i>Dutch</i> Troops already
employ'd their utmost Forces, with much
ado they resisted their combin'd Strength;
and the Revolt of <i>Catalonia</i>, he fear'd, might
invite other Provinces to do the like.</p>

<p>There was no one now in the Court of
<i>Madrid</i> ignorant of the News, but the King
himself; every one thought that he ought to
be inform'd of it, yet no one dar'd undertake
the ungrateful Task, for fear of incurring
the Minister's Displeasure, whose implacable
Temper they knew too well, to hope
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that he would ever forgive an Offence of this
nature. At last the Duke, seeing that the
Story was too well known to be any longer
conceal'd from the King, and fearing that
some of his Enemies, either to ingratiate or
revenge themselves, should tell it in such a
manner, that the whole Fault would seem to
fall upon him, he resolv'd to be himself the
Messenger, and coming up to the King, with
a serene Look, and a Face on which a dissembled
Joy sat confess'd, "I wish your
Majesty Joy," <i>said he</i>, "of a noble Dutchy,
and a fine Estate, which are lately fallen
to you." "How <i>Olivarez!" answer'd the
King</i>; "what do you mean?" "Mean!"
<i>reply'd the Minister</i>; "why the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>
is run mad, the Mob have proclaimed
him King of <i>Portugal</i>, and he has accepted
the Title; so that now all he has is confiscated,
and you have a good Pretence to
rid yourself of the whole Family: Henceforwards
you may reign King of <i>Portugal</i>,
nor fear that any one will dispute your Title
to that Kingdom."</p>

<p>As weak a Prince as <i>Philip</i> was, he easily
comprehended the meaning of these words;
but as he could no longer see but thro his
Minister's Eyes, he only told him, That he
must take care betimes to put an end to a
Rebellion, whose Consequence might otherwise
prove dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jan. 28.<br />
1644.</i></div>

<p>Mean while the King of <i>Portugal</i> took all
the necessary Measures to confirm his new
Authority. As soon as he came to <i>Lisbon</i>,
he nam'd Governours for every Town of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<i>Portugal</i>, as much distinguish'd for their Fidelity
to him, as for their Experience and
approv'd Valour; who immediately, with
what Soldiers they could get together, went
to take possession of their Command, and to
put the Place in a posture of Defence. At
the same time recruiting Commissions were
given out; and the Solemnity of his Coronation
being over, he call'd together the States
of the Kingdom: in which, to prevent all
the Doubts and Scruples which might rise in
the Minds of the People, his Pretensions to
the Crown were examin'd, and by a solemn
Decree of the States he was acknowledg'd
Rightful and Lawful King, as being descended
from Prince <i>Edward</i>, Son to King <i>Emanuel</i>;
whereas the King of <i>Spain</i> was only
descended from a Daughter of the same King
<i>Emanuel</i>, who also by the Fundamental Laws
of <i>Portugal</i> was excluded the Succession, having
espous'd a foreign Prince.</p>

<p>In this Assembly the King declar'd, that
he would content himself with his own
Estate, and that the usual Royal Revenue
should be apply'd to the defraying of the extraordinary
Expences, and paying the Debts
of the Kingdom. And the better to ingratiate
himself with the People, he took off all
the Taxes which the oppressing <i>Spaniards</i> had
laid upon them.</p>

<p>To all the considerable Offices and Employments
he promoted those of the Conspirators,
whose Birth and Capacity might give
them just Pretensions to it, and who had
shewn the greatest Desire of raising him to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the Throne. In this Promotion no notice
was taken of <i>Pinto</i>; the King did not think
his Royalty sufficiently confirm'd, to venture
at raising one of his Servants, and whose
Extraction was but mean. However, the
Prince was not in the least unmindful of his
Service, and without having the Title of a
Minister of State, he had the Authority of
one; so great was his Influence over his Master,
and such entire Confidence did he repose
in him.</p>

<p>Having given all the necessary Orders
within the Kingdom, he resolv'd to assure
himself of some foreign Assistance in case of
necessity, as well by making strict Alliances
with all the Enemies of <i>Spain</i>, as by raising
them new ones. To this end he endeavour'd
to persuade the Duke of <i>Medina Sidonia</i>, Governour
of <i>Andalusia</i>, and his Brother-in-law,
to follow his Example, shake off the <i>Spanish</i>
Yoke, and make himself an independent
Prince. The Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, a <i>Spanish</i>
Nobleman, and related to the Queen of <i>Portugal</i>,
was to negotiate this Business, the Success
of which will be seen in the Sequel of
this History.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Portugal</i> made a League offensive
and defensive with the <i>Dutch</i>; <i>France</i>
promis'd him its Protection, and he sent Ambassadors
to all the Courts of <i>Europe</i>, that his
Title might be acknowledg'd by their Princes.
But the King of <i>Spain</i> was so destitute
of Men, <i>Catalonia</i> employing all his Forces,
that he did very little all that Campaign for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the Recovery of <i>Portugal</i>, and even what
he did undertake met with no Success.</p>

<p>Some little time after this, News was
brought that <i>Goa</i>, and all those other Places
which belong'd to <i>Portugal</i>, whether in the
<i>Indies</i>, <i>Africa</i>, or in <i>Peru</i>, had follow'd the
Example of their <i>European</i> Masters, and revolted
from the <i>Spaniards</i>. Thus was the
King flatter'd with the Prospect of a happy
Reign, and rejoic'd to see Peace and Tranquillity
preserv'd within his Kingdom, whilst
his Arms met with Success abroad; little
suspecting the Danger which threaten'd his
Life and Crown, both which he had almost
lost by a cursed Conspiracy, which was
form'd even in the midst of that Prince's
Court.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of <i>Braga</i>, as has before
been observ'd, was wholly devoted to the
King of <i>Spain</i>, during whose Reign in <i>Portugal</i>
he had had a great share in the Ministry.
He now plainly saw, that he must never
hope for any Preferment, unless the <i>Spanish</i>
Government could be again introduc'd
into that Kingdom; besides, he fear'd that
the new King, who out of a tender regard
to his Character, had not had him put into
Prison with the other <i>Spaniards</i>, might alter
his Mind, and seeing his Authority once confirm'd,
and dreading no longer the Danger of
incensing the People, or provoking the Inquisition,
might make him share the Fate of
those, whose Courage or Politicks 'twas
thought might prove prejudicial to the new
King's Government, and who had all been depriv'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of their Liberty. But the chief Motive
which induc'd him to undertake something
for their Cause, was his Affection to the late
Vice-Queen: with impatience he beheld that
Princess under Confinement, especially in a
Place where he thought it was her Right to
rule; and his Rage was violently increas'd
by the Orders which were given her Guards
to admit neither the Prelate, nor any other
Person of Quality, the King having been inform'd
that she endeavour'd to infuse Sentiments
of Rebellion into all those <i>Portuguese</i>
who went to visit her; and therefore thought
fit to deprive her of that Liberty, which she
so palpably abus'd. As just and as necessary
as this Proceeding was, the Archbishop call'd
it cruel and tyrannick; and as he had some
Notions of Gratitude, believ'd himself under
an Obligation of doing something for the
Liberty of a Princess, who had done so much
for him. The remembrance of her past Kindness
enflam'd his Soul with Anger, and made
him resolve to embrace any Opportunity
whatsoever of revenging himself on her Enemies,
and delivering her out of their hands.
But as he plainly saw it would be impossible
either to surprize or corrupt her Guards, he
could not think of any surer way than going
directly to the Fountain-head, and by the
Death of the King to restore her Liberty and
Authority both at once.</p>

<p>Being fully confirm'd in this Resolution,
he began to think of the speediest Means of
putting it in execution, well knowing that
he should not long enjoy the Place of President
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the Palace, which was not as yet
taken from him. He plainly saw that it was
in vain to follow the King's Measures, by
endeavouring to win the People, and make
them join with him; their Hatred to the
<i>Spaniards</i> being too deeply rooted in their
Hearts. The Nobility, he was assur'd, wou'd
not assist him, since by their means the
Crown was placed upon the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>'s
Head: he could therefore only depend
upon the Grandees, who with envy
beheld one that had been their Equal, upon
the Throne. The first thing he did,
was to assure himself of <i>Olivarez</i>'s Protection
and Assistance: after which, he began
to work upon the Marquiss of <i>Villareal</i>;
to whom he represented, that the
new King was timorous and diffident, for
which reason he sought all opportunities of
ruining his Family, lest he should leave a
Subject who was capable of disputing the
Crown with his Successor: That he and the
Duke <i>d'Aveiro</i>, who were both of the Royal
Blood, were not thought worthy of any
Office or Employment; whilst all Places of
Trust were fill'd by a company of factious
and seditious People: That with indignation
the People saw how little he was valued,
and were very much troubled to think
that a Person of his Quality and Capacity
must spend his time at a Country-Seat, and
in an inglorious Ease: That one of his
Birth and Estate was too great to be the Subject
of so petty a Prince as the King of <i>Portugal</i>:
That he had lost a Master in the King
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of <i>Spain</i>, who only was capable of bestowing
such Employments on him as he deserv'd, by
reason of the many Kingdoms of which he
was Sovereign, and over which he must establish
Governours.</p>

<p>Seeing that this Discourse made an impression
on the Mind of the Marquiss, he
went so far as to assure him, that he had
Orders from the King of <i>Spain</i> to promise
him the Viceroyalty of <i>Portugal</i>, as a Reward
of his Loyalty, in case he would assist him
in his Design of recovering that Kingdom.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what the Archbishop promis'd,
the thing was very far from his
Heart; his chief Aim being to restore the
Dutchess of <i>Mantua</i> to her Liberty and former
Authority: for the compassing of which,
he thought it very lawful to promise what
he never intended to perform; and he knew
that ambitious Motives were the likeliest to
engage the Marquiss <i>de Villareal</i>, upon whom
his fair Speeches had at last such an effect,
that he yielded to his Persuasions, and promis'd
that he, with his Son the Duke of <i>Camino</i>,
would be at the head of the Enterprize.</p>

<p>This Prelate being thus assur'd of these
two Princes, made it his next business to
engage the Grand Inquisitor, who was his
intimate Friend, and than whom no one
could be more necessary in carrying on their
great Design; seeing that by his means he
should also prevail upon all the Officers belonging
to the Inquisition, a People more to
be dreaded by honest Men than Rogues, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
who bear a great sway amongst the <i>Portuguese</i>.
He endeavour'd at first to alarm his Conscience,
by reminding him of the Oath of
Allegiance which he had taken to the King
of <i>Spain</i>, and which he ought not to break
in favour of an usurping Tyrant; but finding
the Inquisitor a true Churchman, over
whom Interest had a greater sway than Conscience,
he told him that he must join in the
Plot, if he hoped to keep his Place much
longer, for that the new King made it his
business to give all the Employments to Persons
whose Fidelity he could depend upon.</p>

<p>After this, he spent several Months in encreasing
the Number of Conspirators, the
chief of which were the Commissary <i>de la
Crusada</i>; the Count <i>d'Armamar</i>, Nephew to
the Archbishop; the Count <i>de Ballerais</i>; Don
<i>Augustin Emanuel</i>; <i>Antonio Correa</i>, that Clerk
of <i>Vasconcellos</i>, to whom <i>Menezes</i> had given
divers Stabs on the first Day of the Revolution;
<i>Laurento Pidez Carvable</i>, Keeper of the
Royal Treasury; with several others, who
were the Creatures of the <i>Spanish</i> Ministers,
to whom they ow'd their Fortunes and their
Places, and which they could not hope to
keep long, unless by once more introducing
the <i>Spanish</i> Government.</p>

<p>There were also a vast number of <i>Jews</i>
who were concern'd in the Plot, and who
had long liv'd at <i>Lisbon</i> in an outward Profession
of the Christian Faith. These had
lately offer'd the King a vast Sum of Money,
if he would free them from the Persecution
of the Inquisitors, and let them have their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Synagogues at <i>Lisbon</i>; but the Prince rejected
their Offer, and deny'd their Petition. This
had thrown the chief of them into a great
Consternation, for appearing at the head of
the Petitioners, they had made themselves
known, and thereby expos'd themselves to
all the Torments which the Inquisition could
invent.</p>

<p>With these the Archbishop took care to
get acquainted, and taking advantage of the
Confusion they were in, promis'd them his
Protection, which was not to be despis'd,
since he had such an Influence over the Grand
Inquisitor; but insinuated at the same time,
that they were in danger of being banish'd
<i>Portugal</i> by the King, who affected very much
to be thought a true and pious Catholick:
and at the same time promis'd in the Name
of the King of <i>Spain</i>, that if they would be
instrumental to his Restoration, they should
have Liberty of Conscience, and Leave openly
to profess their Religion.</p>

<p>So violent was the Passion of the Archbishop,
that he was not asham'd to make use
of the profess'd Enemies of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, to
drive a <i>Christian</i> Prince from a Throne,
which rightfully belong'd to him; and this
was perhaps the first time that ever the Inquisition
and Synagogue went hand in hand
together.</p>

<p>Several Schemes were propos'd, but at
last this, which was drawn by the Archbishop,
and approv'd of by the first Minister
of <i>Spain</i>, was agreed upon; That the <i>Jews</i>
should set fire to the four Corners of the Palace
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
on the 5th of <i>August</i>, and at the same
time to several Houses both in the City and
Suburbs, that the People might every where
be employ'd in extinguishing the Fire; that
the Conspirators should all fly to the Palace
under pretence of assisting, and that amidst
the Horrour and Confusion which this vast
Conflagration would cause, some of them
should assassinate the King; that the Duke
<i>de Camino</i> should seize the Queen and her
Children, who might be as serviceable to
them in regaining the Citadel, as the Dutchess
of <i>Mantua</i> had been to their Enemies; that
at the same time there should be Fireworks
ready to be play'd off, to set the <i>Portuguese</i>
Fleet on fire; that the Archbishop, with the
Grand Inquisitor and all his Officers, should
march thro the Town, to keep the People in
awe, and prevent their coming to the Assistance
of the King, so much do they dread the
Power of the Inquisition; and that the Marquiss
<i>de Villareal</i> should take the Administration
upon him, till they had receiv'd Orders
from the Court of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>But as they had not the least reason to
hope that the People would second them,
they thought it necessary to make sure of
some Troops, and to that end wrote to <i>Olivarez</i>
to send a Fleet towards the Coasts of
<i>Portugal</i>, which should be ready to enter the
Port of <i>Lisbon</i> at the time when the Conspiracy
should break out; and that there should
be some Forces on foot on the Frontiers of
the Kingdom, which should be in a readiness
to act against any Place, which would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
not willingly surrender to the King of
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>But the most difficult part of their Labour
was to keep an exact Correspondence with
the <i>Spanish</i> Minister: for since the King had
been inform'd that the Dutchess of <i>Mantua</i>
had sent Letters to <i>Madrid</i>, there was such a
strict Guard kept upon the Frontiers of the
Kingdom, that no one could go into <i>Castile</i>
without the King's own Passport; nor did
they dare attempt to corrupt the Guards,
lest they should reveal what had been offer'd
them.</p>

<p>But at last, seeing themselves under an absolute
Necessity of acquainting the <i>Spanish</i>
Minister with their Design, without which
all their Measures would infallibly be broken;
they cast their Eyes upon a rich Merchant
of <i>Lisbon</i>, who was Treasurer of the
Custom-House, and who, by reason of his
great Trade, had the King's immediate leave
to send Letters into <i>Castile</i> at any time. This
Man's Name was <i>Baeze</i>; he outwardly profess'd
the Christian Religion, but was suppos'd
to be a conceal'd Observer of the <i>Jewish</i>
Law. To him they offer'd vast Sums of
Money for his Assistance; which, together
with the Persuasions of the <i>Jews</i> who were
engag'd in the Conspiracy, prevail'd upon
him so far, that he promis'd to take care that
their Letters should be deliver'd to the Duke
<i>d'Olivarez</i>.</p>

<p>To this end he enclos'd the Pacquet directed
to the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, Governour
of the first Town on the Frontiers of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<i>Spain</i>, believing his Letters safe, when once
out of the Dominions of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p>The Marquiss, who was nearly related
to the Queen, and was at that time negotiating
a Business for the King of <i>Portugal</i>,
was very much surpriz'd to see Letters seal'd
with the Great Seal of the Inquisition, and
directed to the first Minister of <i>Spain</i>; and
beginning to fear that his own Business was
discover'd, and notice of it hereby given to
<i>Olivarez</i>, he open'd them, and found that
they contain'd the Scheme of a Conspiracy
against the Royal Family, and which was
speedily to be put in execution.</p>

<p>Startled at the Contents, he dispatch'd a
Courier to the Court of <i>Portugal</i> with the
intercepted Letters. It is impossible to express
the Surprize of the King, when he
saw that three Princes, who were so nearly
related to him, with the Archbishop, and
several Grandees of the Kingdom, were contriving
how to take away his Life, and give
his Crown to a Stranger.</p>

<p>He immediately communicated their intended
Treason to his Privy-Council, who after a
small Deliberation came to a Resolution, which
some few days afterwards was executed.
The fifth of <i>October</i> was the Day appointed
by the Conspirators, and the Time Eleven
at Night. That very Morning, about Ten
of the Clock, all the Soldiers who were
quarter'd in the neighbouring Villages,
march'd into <i>Lisbon</i>, it having been given out
that they were then to be review'd in the
Court of the Palace. The King at the same
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
time gave Notes with his own hand to several
Officers and others of his Court, which
were seal'd up, with positive Orders not to
open them till Twelve, and then punctually
to execute the Contents.</p>

<p>A little before Noon the Archbishop and
the Marquiss <i>de Villareal</i> were sent for to the
Palace about some Business, and coming into
the King's Apartment, were arrested without
the least noise, or any body's knowing
it; and at the same time one of the Captains
of the Guard made the Duke <i>de Camino</i> a
Prisoner. Those who had receiv'd the seal'd
Notes having open'd them, found Orders to
arrest such a Man, whom they should convey
to such a Prison, and not lose sight of him
till farther Orders. In short, Matters were
manag'd so prudently, that in less than an
hour's time the Forty-seven Conspirators were
seiz'd, without so much as giving any one
of them time enough to escape, or even the
least suspicion that their Plot was discover'd.</p>

<p>The News of their intended Barbarity
reaching the ears of the People, they came
flocking towards the Palace, and in a tumultuous
manner demanded the Prisoners, that
they might tear them piece-meal.</p>

<p>Tho the King was well pleas'd with the
Affection and Loyalty of his Subjects, yet
was he a little troubled to see how easily they
could be gather'd together, and what mischief
they were at such a time able to do.
Wherefore having thank'd them for the care
which they took of him, and having promis'd
that the Traitors should be punish'd according
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
to Law, he order'd the Magistrates to
disperse them.</p>

<p>But as he knew that the most violent Passions
of an incens'd People will soon grow cool,
and perhaps dwindle into Compassion, when
they no longer should consider the Criminals
as the worst of Villains, who would have
destroy'd their King and Country, but as
unhappy Wretches, who must shortly suffer
an ignominious Death; he took care to publish,
that the Conspirators Intent was to assassinate
him and all the Royal Family, to set
the whole Town on fire, and those who escaped
the raging Flames, should have fallen
by the Sword of the Rebels: That <i>Spain</i> being
resolv'd to have nothing more to fear
from the <i>Portuguese</i>, would have sent all their
Citizens into <i>America</i>, to toil like Slaves, and
be bury'd alive in those Mines, where so many
had already perish'd, and to people the
City of <i>Lisbon</i> with a Colony of <i>Castilians</i>.</p>

<p>After this the King order'd the Traitors
to be brought to their Tryal, and to this
end he appointed Judges, which he took out
of the supreme Court of Judicature, and to
whom he added two Grandees of the Kingdom,
upon account of the Archbishop of
<i>Braga</i>, the Marquiss <i>de Villareal</i>, and the
Duke <i>de Camino</i>.</p>

<p>The King put their Letters, which they
had sent to <i>Olivarez</i>, into the hands of those
who were appointed to prosecute them; but
with Orders not to make use of them, if they
could by any other means prove them guilty of
High Treason, lest the Court of <i>Spain</i> should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
thereby discover the Correspondence which
he held with the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>: but
there was no necessity of producing them to
discover the Truth; for <i>Baeze</i>, who was the
first that was brought to the Bar, contradicted
himself in almost every Question which was
ask'd him, and being put to the Torture,
his Courage fail'd him, he confess'd his
Crime, and discover'd the whole Plan of the
Conspiracy. He own'd that their Design
was to kill the King, that the Office of the
Inquisition was now full of Arms, and that
they waited only for <i>Olivarez</i>'s Answer to
execute their Design.</p>

<p>Most of the other Conspirators were put
to the Torture, and their Deposition entirely
agreed with <i>Baeze</i>'s. The Archbishop, the
Grand Inquisitor, the Marquiss <i>de Villareal</i>,
and the Duke <i>de Camino</i>, being unwilling to
suffer the Torments of the Question, confess'd
their Crime. These two last were condemn'd
to be beheaded, the rest of the Lay-Traitors
to be hang'd, drawn and quarter'd,
and the Sentence of the Ecclesiasticks was refer'd
to the King himself. Upon this the
King immediately assembled his Council, and
told them, that the consequence of putting
so many Persons of Quality to death, altho
they were criminal, might be fatal: That
the chief Conspirators were of the first Families
of the Kingdom, whose Relations
would be for ever his conceal'd Enemies, and
that the Desire of revenging their Death
would be the unhappy Source of new Plots:
That the Consequence of the Death of Count
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<i>d'Egmont</i> in <i>Flanders</i>, and of the <i>Guises</i> in
<i>France</i>, had prov'd fatal: That if he pardon'd
some of them, and chang'd the Sentence
of the others into a Punishment less
severe than Death, he should for ever win
theirs, their Friends, and their Kindreds
Hearts, and bind them to his Service by the
Ties of Gratitude: but yet, That notwithstanding
he himself was inclin'd to Mercy,
he had assembled his Council to know their
Opinions, and to follow that which should
seem the most reasonable, and the most
just.</p>

<p>The Marquiss <i>de Ferreira</i> was the first
who spoke, and was for having them executed
without delay: he represented, That in
such cases as these Justice only ought to be
consulted, and that Mercy was most dangerous:
That Pardon would seem not so
much the Effect of the Goodness, as
Weakness of the Prince, or the Fear of
their threatning powerful Friends: That
if these should go unpunish'd, it would
bring the Government into Contempt, and
encourage their Relations to deliver them out
of Prison, or perhaps to carry Matters farther:
That now, at his Accession to the
Crown, he ought, by an Example of Severity,
to deter others from ever attempting
the like. He urg'd farther, That they were
Traitors not only to the King, but also to
the State, whose present Constitution they
had endeavour'd to subvert: That he ought
rather to hearken to the Justice which he
ow'd his People, and punish these Criminals,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
than to his own Inclination of forgiving them,
especially at a time when his Preservation and
the publick Safety were inseparable.</p>

<p>The whole Council being of the same
opinion, the King yielded, and the next day
Sentence was executed. The Archbishop of
of <i>Lisbon</i> being willing to save one of his
Friends, came to the Queen, and sollicited
her for a Pardon, with all the Assurance of a
Man, who thought that nothing could be
deny'd him, and that his former Services
might claim a much greater Favour. But
the Queen, who was convinc'd of the Justice
and absolute Necessity of their suffering the
Law, and how much a Distinction of this
nature would incense the Friends and Relations
of the rest, answer'd the Archbishop
in few words, but with such a Tone, as
made him see it would be in vain to urge his
Request any farther; "My Lord, the only
Favour I can now grant you, is to forget
that you ever ask'd me this."</p>

<p>The King, unwilling to disoblige the Clergy,
and especially the Court of <i>Rome</i>, who
had not as yet acknowledg'd him King, or
receiv'd his Ambassadors, would not suffer
the Archbishop of <i>Braga</i>, or the Grand Inquisitor,
to be executed, but condemn'd
them to a perpetual Imprisonment; where
the Archbishop shortly after died of a violent
Fever, a Disease often fatal to State-Prisoners,
who for some politick Reason
must not be led to open Execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could be equal to the Surprize of
<i>Olivarez</i>, when this News was brought him;
he could not imagine by what means the
King of <i>Portugal</i> had discover'd their Design,
nor would it ever have been known, had not an
Accident happen'd, which made him see that
it was the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, who had unravel'd
the dark Design, and acquainted the
King with it.</p>

<p>This Prince still kept a very good Correspondence
with the Enemies of <i>Spain</i>, his
Ports were open to the Fleets of <i>France</i> and
<i>Holland</i>; he had a Resident at <i>Barcelona</i>, and
encourag'd the revolting <i>Catalonians</i>: in short,
he did all he could to weaken <i>Spain</i>, not only
by increasing the Rage of its Foes, but also
by endeavouring to raise up new ones. To
this end, he had already inclin'd the Duke
<i>de Medina Sidonia</i>, his Brother-in-law, to rebel;
whom the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, a <i>Castilian</i>,
and their mutual Confidant, at length
entirely seduced. This Nobleman was, as
has been before observ'd, nearly related to
the Queen of <i>Portugal</i>, and the Duke of <i>Medina</i>:
He was Governour of a Place at the
Mouth of the <i>Guadiano</i>, and just on the
Frontiers of <i>Portugal</i>, which made it easy for
him to keep a good Correspondence with that
Court; nor did he question, but that by being
serviceable to two such powerful Families,
he should easily make his own Fortune.
He was valiant, enterprizing, hated the first
Minister, and at the same time did not in the
least value his Life; a Quality so very necessary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to those who embark themselves in any
dangerous Design.</p>

<p>He wrote privately to the Duke, to congratulate
him upon the Discovery of the
Archbishop's Plot, and the Preservation of
the Life of the Queen his Sister, and all the
Royal Family; he at the same time observ'd
how grateful it must be to him to see the
Crown of <i>Portugal</i> one day adorn the Head
of his Nephews, which made that Kingdom
a sure Refuge for him in time of Distress:
which perhaps might be too near at hand,
since he could never reckon himself safe while
<i>Olivarez</i> was at the head of Affairs, whose
only aim was to ruin all the Grandees; nor
was it to be suppos'd that the crafty Statesman
would long leave him Governour of so
large a Province, and in the Neighbourhood
of <i>Portugal</i>: That he would advise him seriously
to reflect on all these things, and let
him know his Resolutions; to which end he
should send him a Person in whom he could
confide, and to whom they both might safely
trust their Secret.</p>

<p>The Duke was naturally proud and ambitious,
and with Envy had beheld his Brother-in-law
raising himself to the Throne;
nor would he, on his side, willingly neglect
any Opportunity of doing the like. Believing
by what the Marquiss said, that he had
some very advantageous Proposal of this kind
to make him, he sent <i>Lewis de Castile</i>, his
Confidant, to <i>Daiamonti</i>, who seeing his Credentials,
at once open'd his Mind, and bid him
remember with what ease the Duke of <i>Braganza</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
had made himself Master of the Crown
of Portugal; nor could there ever be a more
favourable time for the Duke of <i>Medina Sidonia</i>
to do the like, and make himself independent
of the Crown of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>After this he represented the Weakness of
that Kingdom, which was exhausted by the
Wars which the <i>French</i> and <i>Dutch</i> had continually
waged against them: That <i>Catalonia</i>
now employ'd all its Forces, nor would the
King know how to help himself, should <i>Andalusia</i>
rise in Arms against him, and the War
be thus carry'd into the very Heart of the
Kingdom: That the People would certainly
side with him, being always fond of a new
Government; besides which, they had reason
enough to complain of the old one, which
had so oppress'd them with Taxes, and extorted
such vast Sums from them: That the
Duke of <i>Medina</i> was as well beloved by the
<i>Andalusians</i>, as the Duke of <i>Braganza</i> was at
the time of the Revolution by the <i>Portuguese</i>:
That the only thing which now remain'd to
be done, was to gain all those, who, under
him, were Governours of Towns and Forts,
without entrusting them with the Secret,
which might be done; and to fill all Places of
Trust with his surest Friends: That as soon as
the Galloons, which were expected from the
<i>Indies</i>, arriv'd, he should seize them, and the
Riches which were on board would defray the
Expences of this Enterprize: That the King
of <i>Portugal</i>, with his Allies, should have a
Fleet ready to enter <i>Cadiz</i>, and there land a
sufficient Number of Forces, to subdue those
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
who would unseasonably shew their Loyalty
to <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lewis de Castile</i> being return'd to his Master,
gave him a faithful Account of all that
had pass'd between him and the Marquiss.
The Duke, dazled with the Prospect of a
Crown, resolv'd to hazard every thing, rather
than fail of obtaining one. He was
chief Commander there both by Sea and
Land, as Captain-General of the Ocean, and
Governour of the Province, in which he also
had a very large Estate, and several Towns
under his own immediate Jurisdiction. This
seem'd very much to facilitate his Design,
and made him believe, that it was in his
power to put a Crown upon his Head whenever
he pleas'd.</p>

<p>Upon this he sent <i>Lewis de Castile</i> back to
the Marquiss, that they might together agree
upon the properest Measures of accomplishing
their Project, and especially of engaging
the Crown of <i>Portugal</i> to lend them all the
Assistance it possibly could. Mean while,
he himself was disposing every thing for the
intended Revolution; he put his own Creatures
in all those Places where their Assistance
would be most serviceable to him; he frequently
would pity the Soldiers, who were
not paid as they ought to be, and the People,
who were over-burden'd with excessive
Taxes.</p>

<p>The Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i> was well pleas'd
to see the Duke in that Disposition he had
long wish'd to see him in; he wanted to acquaint
the King of <i>Portugal</i> with it, but was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
unwilling to trust to Letters, and fear'd he
could not send a Messenger so privately, but
that the Court of <i>Spain</i> might discover it,
and have just cause to mistrust his Fidelity:
However, at last he cast his eyes upon a crafty
and intriguing Monk, who for love of
Money, or hope of Preferment, would undertake
any thing; he was call'd Father
<i>Nicholas de Valasco</i>, of the Order of <i>St. Francis</i>.
No one could be fitter for his purpose,
since in the Countries where the Inquisition
is, this Habit is so much respected, that no
one would dare to pry into his Actions, and
observe his Steps.</p>

<p>As soon as he had receiv'd his Instructions,
he came to <i>Castro-Marino</i>, the first Town on
the Frontiers of <i>Portugal</i>, pretending to ransom
some <i>Castilian</i> Prisoners which were detain'd
in <i>Portugal</i>. The King, who had notice
given him of it, by a Letter from the
Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, was desir'd to seize
him, and bring him to Court: This was accordingly
done; he was arrested as a Spy,
loaded with Chains, and brought to <i>Lisbon</i>
as a State-Criminal, whom the Ministry themselves
would examine; where he was immediately
cast into Prison, and seemingly
watch'd very strictly: some time after he
was set at liberty, since upon Examination it
appear'd, that his only Intent was to ransom
some <i>Castilian</i> Prisoners; and partly, to make
him amends for his former ill Usage, he was
permitted to come to Court, to treat with
the proper Officer about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The King saw him himself several times,
and promis'd him, that as a Reward of his
Industry and faithful Service, he would give
him a Bishoprick. The Monk, flatter'd with
the hopes of the Mitre, would never stir
from the Palace; he made his court to the
Queen, and was always waiting upon the
Ministers: He wanted to be let into all the
State-Intrigues, and did all he could to shew
what Credit he had at Court; and thus,
without directly revealing his Secret, he betray'd
it by his Pride and Inconsiderateness.
It plainly appear'd, that the Severity of his
Prison was only a blind, and the Examination
of the Ministry a pretence to introduce
him into Court. Many and various were the
Conjectures which were made about his real
Business there; but at last a <i>Castilian</i>, who
was Prisoner at <i>Lisbon</i>, discover'd the whole
Intrigue.</p>

<p>This <i>Castilian</i>, nam'd <i>Sancho</i>, was a Creature
of the Duke of <i>Medina Sidonia</i>'s, and,
before the late Revolution, Pay-Master of
the <i>Spanish</i> Army in <i>Portugal</i>. He, with the
rest of his Countrymen who were taken up
at that time, groan'd in Confinement, nor
had they any prospect of Liberty; but hearing
of this Monk, and being inform'd of his
Country, his extravagant Conduct, his Credit
at Court, and several other Circumstances,
which made it plain that he was there employ'd
in some secret Business; he thought
he had now an opportunity of obtaining his
Liberty, and with this hope he wrote the
Monk a long Letter, full of Expressions fit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to sooth his Vanity; in it he complain'd,
that the King of <i>Portugal</i> detain'd him in
Prison, (with the other <i>Castilians</i>) who was
a Servant and Creature of the Duke his Brother-in-law:
and to confirm it, he sent him
several Letters, wrote to him by that Prince
himself some little time before the Revolution,
in which he treated him as one in whom
he repos'd an entire Confidence.</p>

<p>The <i>Franciscan</i> answer'd <i>Sancho</i>'s Letter,
and assur'd him, that nothing could recommend
him more to him, than his belonging
to the Duke of <i>Medina</i>; that he would use
all his endeavour to procure him his Liberty,
but in the mean time he must take care not
so much as to open his mouth about it.
The <i>Spaniard</i> waited some days for the Effect
of his Promise, and at last sent him a
second Epistle, in which he represented, that
seven Months were expir'd since he was cast
into Prison; that the <i>Spanish</i> Minister seem'd
to have quite forgotten him, since he neither
talk'd of ransoming or exchanging him; and
that therefore he had no hopes of Liberty
left, but what were built upon the Charity
and Interest of the Reverend Father.</p>

<p>The Monk, who thought he should very
much oblige the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, by procuring
<i>Sancho</i> his Freedom, begg'd it of the
King, and obtain'd it. He went to the Prison
himself, to fetch him out of it, and offer'd
to have him included in a Passport,
which was to be given to some of the
Dutchess of <i>Mantua</i>'s Servants, who were
then returning to <i>Madrid</i>. But the crafty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
<i>Castilian</i> answer'd him, that <i>Madrid</i> was a
Place to which he could never more return;
that he must not pretend to appear at Court,
unless he desir'd to be thrown into Prison
again, seeing that <i>Olivarez</i> was so severe and
unjust, that he would expect his Accounts to
be made up, altho in the late Revolution he
had been stript not only of his Money, but had
had his Books also taken from him: To this
he added, that he desir'd nothing more than
to be near the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, his Patron,
who was both able and willing, he did not
question, to advance him.</p>

<p>The <i>Franciscan</i> wanting somebody whom
he could trust his Secret to, and by whom
he might give the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i> a strict
Account of his Negotiation, cast his eyes
upon the <i>Castilian</i>, who seem'd very much
attach'd to the Interest of the Duke of <i>Medina</i>.
To this end he detain'd the <i>Spaniard</i>
some time, pretending that he could not as
yet procure him a Passport, tho his Intent
was to observe him, and see whether or not
he was a Person fit to be entrusted. Their
being frequently together begat an intimate
Acquaintance, which they both mutually desir'd;
the Monk, that he might engage the
<i>Spaniard</i> to serve him; and the <i>Spaniard</i>, that
he might make himself Master of the Monk's
Secret.</p>

<p>This holy Man, like the rest of his Brethren,
puff'd up with Vanity, could not forbear
one day telling his Friend, that he
would not long see him in that Garb in
which he was, that he had a Bishoprick
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
promis'd him, and that he did not despair of
obtaining the <i>Roman</i> Purple. <i>Sancho</i>, to make
him prattle the faster, pretended that he did
not believe a word of what he said. The
Fryar laugh'd at his Incredulity: "And I
suppose, <i>continued he</i>, you would not believe
me neither, if I should tell you, that
the Duke of <i>Medina</i> will shortly be a
King." The other, to get the Secret
quite out of him, urg'd the Impossibility of
it; upon which the Monk told him the
whole Story: That <i>Andalusia</i> must in a little
time acknowledge the Duke for their Sovereign:
That the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, who
had also discover'd the <i>Spanish</i> Plot to the
King of <i>Portugal</i>, was the chief Negotiator
and Instrument of this intended Revolution:
That he should shortly see strange Alterations
in <i>Spain</i>, and that he had now an opportunity
of making his Fortune only by being
secret, and taking care to deliver some
Letters from him to the Duke and Marquiss.</p>

<p><i>Sancho</i>, well pleas'd at the Discovery of
this Secret, which he had long labour'd to
get out of him, renew'd his Protestations of
Fidelity and Secrecy, and his Offers of Service;
and having taken <i>Velasco</i>'s Letters, told
him, that he should be proud of the Opportunity
of serving the Prince, and hoped that
he should be thought worthy of the Honour
of bringing him an Answer. Upon this the
<i>Castilian</i> set out for <i>Andalusia</i>, but was no
sooner got into the <i>Spanish</i> Territories, than
he took the <i>Madrid</i> Road; and as soon as he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
arriv'd, went strait to the Minister's House,
and sent him word that <i>Sancho</i>, Pay-Master
of the Army in <i>Portugal</i>, was just escaped
out of Prison, where he had been confin'd
by the Usurper, and had some important Business
to communicate to him.</p>

<p>It was a very hard matter to gain Access
to <i>Olivarez</i>, who had his set Hours of granting
Audience, and at which time he sent
word the Pay-Master must return. Enrag'd
at this Refusal, <i>Sancho</i> cry'd he must, he
would speak to him; that his Business was
no Trifle, but the Safety of the Kingdom
depended on its being immediately reveal'd.</p>

<p>This being told <i>Olivarez</i>, he order'd him
to be admitted: <i>Sancho</i> enter'd the Room,
and threw himself at his feet, crying the
Kingdom was sav'd from the Ruin which
threaten'd it, since he had gain'd Admittance
to one, in whose power it was to prevent
it; then told the whole Story of the
Duke of <i>Medina</i>'s Intent, encourag'd in it
by the King of <i>Portugal</i>, and persuaded to it
by the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, his Design of
seizing upon the Galloons, and of making
the Soldiers of <i>Andalusia</i> turn their Arms against
their King: to justify all which, he
deliver'd those Letters given him by the
<i>Franciscan</i> for the Duke and Marquiss, and
which contain'd the Scheme of the Conspiracy.</p>

<p><i>Olivarez</i>, was so surpriz'd at the Strangeness
of this News, that he could not for
some time utter a word, but at last recovering
himself, he prais'd <i>Sancho</i> for his Loyalty,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and told him that he deserv'd a double Reward,
not only as he had reveal'd the Plot,
but also as he had not been afraid to discover
it even to the nearest Relation of the chief
Conspirator. Then order'd he the <i>Spaniard</i>
to be conducted into a private Apartment,
and be debarr'd the liberty of speaking to
any one.</p>

<p>Mean while the Minister went into the
King's Apartment, and told him all that
<i>Sancho</i> had related, and shew'd him the Letters
which he had deliver'd him.</p>

<p>Never was Prince in a greater Consternation
than <i>Philip</i> was, long had he observ'd
and dreaded the haughty Carriage of the
<i>Gusmans</i>; and as the Loss of <i>Portugal</i>, which
he thought was owing to the Dutchess of
<i>Braganza</i>, was still fresh in his Memory, he
could not forbear telling <i>Olivarez</i>, in a reproachful
manner, that all the Misfortunes
which the <i>Spaniards</i> had lately suffer'd, they
were beholden to his Family for. This Prince
wanted neither Wit or Judgment, but he was
so addicted to Pleasure, that he would never
apply himself to any thing that carry'd the face
of Business, but would rather have lost half
his Dominions, than be oblig'd to quit his
indolent and effeminate manner of Living:
Wherefore having vented his Passion in this
Reproach, he gave the <i>Franciscan</i>'s Letters
back to <i>Olivarez</i>, without so much as opening
them; ordering him to have them examin'd
by a Committee, compos'd of three
Members of his Privy-Council, who should
make their Report to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>This was all that <i>Olivarez</i> desir'd, for
now he could give the Business what Turn
he pleas'd. He chose three of his own Creatures
for the Commissioners, into whose hands
the Letters were put, and by whom <i>Sancho</i>
was examin'd several times; all their Aim
was to acquit the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, to which
end <i>Olivarez</i>, himself came to <i>Sancho</i>, and affecting
an affable Behaviour, and an extraordinary
Kindness for the Man; "How,
my dear <i>Sancho, said</i> he, shall we contrive
to acquit the Duke of <i>Medina</i> of a Crime,
which is testify'd only by the Letters of
an unknown Monk, and who probably
was bribed by the Duke's Enemies to lay
this to his charge; for certain it is, that
never Governour of <i>Andalusia</i> discharg'd
his Duty better, both towards the King
and his Province."</p>

<p><i>Sancho</i>, who was fully persuaded of the
Truth of his Deposition, and fear'd that any
of the Criminals should be acquitted, lest he
should lose his hoped-for Reward, still maintain'd,
that he was well assur'd that there
was an horrid Conspiracy form'd against the
Government in favour of the Duke, who was
also at the head of it; that the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>
was the Contriver of the Plot; and
that he himself had read several of their Letters,
which were shewn him by the <i>Franciscan</i>,
and was certain, that if <i>Olivarez</i> did
not prevent it in time, all <i>Andalusia</i> would
be up in Arms, to make their Governour
their Monarch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Olivarez</i>, very unwilling that this Business
should be too narrowly search'd into, took
an opportunity of telling the King, that the
Monk's Letters had been decypher'd and examin'd,
and that he really believ'd him to be
some Wretch who had been bribed to calumniate
the Duke; for there was no Letter
of his produc'd, nor did <i>Sancho</i> make any
formal Deposition against him. However,
as it was impossible to be too cautious in
such a case as this, his Opinion was, that
the Duke must be artfully drawn to Court,
for if he had any such Design on foot, it was
not safe to arrest him in <i>Andalusia</i>; that some
Forces must be sent to <i>Cadiz</i>, under a new
Governour; that the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>
must be taken up at the same time, and if
they were found guilty, his Majesty might
deliver them over to the Severity of the
Law.</p>

<p>This haughty Minister's Will was not only
generally a Law to the Subjects of <i>Spain</i>, but
was always one to the King; who told him,
that he should manage this Business as he
thought fit, for he left it entirely to him.
Upon this <i>Olivarez</i> sent his Nephew, Don
<i>Lewis d'Haro</i>, to the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, to tell
him what had been depos'd against him, and
with Orders, that guilty or not guilty, he
should immediately come to Court, which
if he did, his Pardon should be granted;
but that if he defer'd his Journey, it would
no longer be in his power to procure it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>This Message thunder-struck the Duke of
<i>Medina</i>, and he saw himself under a necessity
of obeying, or immediately flying into <i>Portugal</i>:
but then considering how ignominious
it was to spend his days in Indolence, and
live a banish'd Man, especially in a Country
where there was no Employment worthy of
him, and at the same time knowing how
great <i>Olivarez</i>'s Power was; he resolv'd to
trust him: and set out for <i>Madrid</i>, and with
such diligence did he pursue his Journey, that
the King was immediately inclin'd to believe
him innocent, or to forgive him, should he
be found guilty.</p>

<p>Whilst Don <i>Lewis d'Haro</i> was employ'd in
this Business, a Messenger was sent to take
up the Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>; and the Duke of
<i>Ciudad-real</i> march'd into <i>Cadiz</i> at the head of
5000 Men.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duke of <i>Medina</i> arriv'd at
<i>Madrid</i>, he went and alighted at <i>Olivarez</i>'s
House, to whom he confess'd the Conspiracy,
shew'd him the Scheme by which they
were to proceed, but cast all the Odium of
it upon the Marquiss. <i>Olivarez</i> that instant
introduc'd him into the King's Closet,
where he threw himself at his Majesty's feet,
and with Tears confess'd his Crime, and
begg'd his pardon. <i>Philip</i>, who was of a soft
and compassionate nature, mix'd his Tears
with the Duke's, and easily forgave him.
But as it would have been very imprudent to
have expos'd him to the same Temptation a
second time, he was order'd to stay at Court;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
part of his Estate was also confiscated, the
King being sensible, that had he not been too
rich, and too powerful, he would never have
made an Attempt of this kind: and a Governour
and a Garison were plac'd in <i>Saint
Lucar de Barameda</i>, the Town in which the
Dukes of <i>Medina Sidonia</i> generally resided.</p>

<p><i>Olivarez</i>, to persuade the King that his
Relation's Repentance was sincere, advis'd
him to send a formal Challenge to the
Duke of <i>Braganza</i>; which he refus'd at first,
objecting that both Divine and Human Laws
forbad Duels. But <i>Olivarez</i> persisting in his
Resolution of having one sent, <i>Medina</i> reply'd,
that he could not in Conscience
come to this Extremity with his Brother-in-law,
unless the King would obtain a Bull
from the Pope, which should secure him from
the Censure of the Church, which always
excommunicated Duelists.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Olivarez</i> answer'd him, that this was not
a time for Scruples of Conscience, but that
he must now think of satisfying both the
King and People of the Sincerity of his Repentance;
that in short it was no matter
whether he would fight or not, provided he
would not disown a Challenge, which he
would publish in his Name. The Duke,
who now plainly saw that <i>Olivarez</i>'s Intent
was only to amuse the People, consented to
it, and the Minister drew up one himself.
Several of them were sent into <i>Portugal</i>, as
well as into most Courts of <i>Europe</i>. A Copy
of it may probably not be displeasing to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Reader, who will be surpriz'd to see a
Challenge, which by its Length, Formality,
and Stile, would better have became a
Knight-Errant of old, than such a Prince as
the Duke of <i>Medina Sidonia</i> was.</p>

</span>
ccording to his Promise, the
Duke of <i>Medina</i> appear'd in the
Lists, follow'd by Don <i>John de Garray</i>,
Lieutenant-General of the <i>Spanish</i> Cavalry;
there the Duke of <i>Braganza</i> was summon'd
in a formal manner: But that Prince
was too prudent to play a part in this Farce;
or had the thing been of a more serious nature,
a Sovereign Prince was not to venture
his Life against a Subject of his Enemy.</p>

<p>Whilst <i>Olivarez</i> amus'd the People in this
manner, he was also taking care to turn the
Resentment of the King and People upon the
Marquiss <i>Daiamonti</i>, whom he intended to
prove the only guilty Person: to this end he
flatter'd him with the Hopes of a Pardon,
and that, as well as the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, he
should taste the Bounties of a merciful
Prince, provided he would be open in his
Confession; but that Kings, like God, whose
Images they were, never forgave any, but
those who heartily and sincerely repented
them of their Crimes.</p>

<p>The Marquiss trusting to this Promise,
which the Duke of <i>Medina</i>'s Example gave
him no room to doubt of, sign'd a Paper
which <i>d'Olivarez</i> brought him, and which he
immediately put into the hands of those who
were to try him. Upon this Confession of
his he was indicted, and condemn'd to be
beheaded. When the Judge pass'd Sentence,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
he heard it without the least Concern, or so
much as murmuring at <i>Olivarez</i> or the Duke.
That same Night he supp'd as heartily as
usual, and when they came to lead him to
Execution the next Morning, he was still
asleep. He ascended the Block without
speaking one word, whilst a Contempt of
Death might be read in his Looks, and died
with a Courage and Resolution worthy of a
better Cause. Such was the end of a Conspiracy,
from which the King of <i>Spain</i> escaped
meerly by Accident, or rather by a
Decree of Providence, which cannot connive
at Crimes of this nature, and will seldom
suffer Treachery to prevail.</p>

<p>The King of <i>Portugal</i> seeing this Project
miscarry, resolv'd to maintain himself on the
Throne no longer by such clandestine Means,
but by open Force, and the Assistance of his
Allies. <i>France</i> seem'd particularly to take
the House of <i>Braganza</i> under its Protection,
as being the most antient Branch of their own
Royal Family.</p>

<p>The foreign War so employ'd the <i>Spanish</i>
Forces, that the <i>Portuguese</i> had always the advantage
over them, and they drove them still
farther from their Frontiers. The King might
easily at that time have enter'd into the very
Center of <i>Castile</i>, had he had a good General,
and disciplin'd Soldiers; but his Army
was chiefly compos'd of Militia, fitter to
make sudden Incursions into the Enemy's
Country, than to bear the Fatigue of a regular
Campaign. Another thing that hinder'd
his making a greater Progress with his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Army, was, that he had not Money enough
to pay them, and consequently not
Forces enough on foot; for as at his coming
to the Crown, he had taken off all Taxes
from the People, that they might the better
relish his Government, and had only his own
Estate to defray the Expences of the War;
nor would he ever venture to lay new Taxes
upon them. But this Want of his was partly
recompens'd by the Necessity of <i>Spain</i>,
who at that time had no better Generals than
the <i>Portuguese</i>, and whose Treasures, towards
the latter end of <i>Philip</i> the Fourth's Reign,
were exhausted.</p>

<p>On the sixth of <i>November</i>, 1656. died this
Prince: in all the Encomiums and Panegyricks
made upon him by the <i>Portuguese</i>, he
is celebrated for his Piety and Moderation.
Foreign Historians upbraid him with Cowardice,
and report, that he always distrusted
both himself and others; that it was a difficult
point, especially for the Grandees, to
get Access to him; and that he was free with
no one but his ancient domestick Servants,
especially with one that was always in company
with his Confessor. In short, from
what we can gather of his Life, he was
a peaceable and religious Prince, and endow'd
with Qualities which would better
have became a private Gentleman than a Monarch;
so that we can attribute his being
rais'd to the Throne only to the inveterate
Hate which the <i>Portuguese</i> bore the <i>Castilians</i>,
and to the Ambition, Courage, and Counsels
of his Queen, whom by his last Will he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
nam'd Regent of the Kingdom during his
Son's Minority; not doubting but that one
who could raise herself to a Throne, would
not want Courage to preserve it for her Children.
He left behind him two Sons and a
Daughter; the elder of the Sons was Don
<i>Alphonso</i>, of a peevish and melancholy Temper,
who had quite lost the Use of one
Side, and was at the time of his Father's
Death near thirteen Years old: Don <i>Pedro</i>,
the younger, was but eight: Donna <i>Catharina</i>
their Sister, was older than either of
them, and was born before the Revolution.</p>

<p>Don <i>Alphonso</i> was immediately shewn to
the People, and proclaim'd King, and the
Queen took the Regency upon her. This
Princess would willingly have signaliz'd herself
by some glorious Action, but the Commanders
of the <i>Portuguese</i> Army were fitter
for Soldiers than Generals, and there was
not an Officer amongst them, who was Engineer
enough to know how to fortify a Place,
or besiege a Town. Nor was there a Man
in the Privy-Council, who could be look'd
upon as a Statesman; most of them could indeed
make fine Speeches and elaborate Discourses
upon the Necessities of the State, and
the Misfortunes in which it would probably
fall, but never a one of them knew how to
prevent or remedy them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">1657.</div>

<p>To these Evils we must attribute the ill
Success of her Arms before <i>Olivenza</i> and <i>Badajos</i>,
where the <i>Spaniards</i> obliged them to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
raise the Siege. Besides this, they had fallen
out with the <i>Dutch</i> about the Trade to the
<i>Indies</i>; and the <i>French</i>, after the <i>Pyrenean</i>
Treaty, seem'd to have forgotten them.</p>

<p>The Queen finding herself without any regular
Troops, without able Officers or good
Counsellors, and without foreign Alliances,
was obliged by her Courage, Capacity, and
Application, to supply the want of all these;
she herself discharg'd the Duty of a Secretary
of State, and took care to keep a good
Correspondence with all the Courts of <i>Europe</i>,
which might be serviceable to her: In
short, had she never encounter'd all these
Difficulties, she could not have reveal'd all
those <i>hidden Vertues, which shun the Day, and
lie conceal'd in the smooth Seasons, and the Calms
of Life</i>.</p>

<p>By such Care and Diligence for a long time
she sav'd <i>Portugal</i> from that Ruin which threaten'd
it; but <i>Spain</i> now pouring all its Forces
in upon her, she found herself unable to resist
them, unless she could procure better Officers.
To this end she cast her Eyes upon <i>Frederick</i>
Count of <i>Schomberg</i>, whose Name and Valour
were already sufficiently known. She
would willingly have given him the chief
Command of the Army, but was afraid at
this juncture of disobliging her Generalissimo;
wherefore she order'd the Count <i>de Soure</i>,
her Ambassador in <i>France</i>, to treat with the
Count <i>de Schomberg</i> about his coming into
<i>Portugal</i>, where he should have only the Title
of Lieutenant-General; but in case of the
Death or Resignation of the present Commander,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
he should be made Generalissimo of
all her Forces.</p>

<p>The Count set out for <i>Lisbon</i> with four-score
Officers, and above four hundred Horsemen,
all Veterans, who perfectly understood
the Discipline of an Army, and would upon
occasion make good Leaders.</p>

<p>Before the Count went into <i>Portugal</i>, he
made a Voyage into <i>England</i>, where he saw
King <i>Charles</i> the Second, who was lately restor'd:
He had private Orders from the Regent,
to endeavour to discover whether King
<i>Charles</i> might be brought to marry the Infanta
of <i>Portugal</i>. The Count negotiated
this Business with so much Address, that he
made both the King and Chancellor <i>Hyde</i>
desirous of this Alliance. The Queen, extremely
satisfy'd with what he had done,
desir'd him to hasten into <i>Portugal</i>, and sent
the Marquiss <i>de Sande</i> to conclude the Business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>May 31.<br />
1662.</i></div>

<p>But the King of <i>Spain</i>, foreseeing what
might be the consequence of this Match,
did all he could to prevent it; he offer'd to
give any Protestant Princess Three Millions
for her Portion, provided the King would
marry her; and by his Ambassador propos'd
the Princesses of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Saxony</i>, or <i>Orange</i>.
But the Chancellor represented to the King
how nearly it concern'd him to maintain the
House of <i>Braganza</i> on the Throne, and not
let <i>Philip</i> become Master of all <i>Spain</i> and the
<i>Indies</i>. His Speech produc'd the desir'd Effect,
and King <i>Charles</i> married the Infanta.
Thus did a Protestant Statesman persuade
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
his Sovereign to marry a Catholick Princess,
whilst a Prince of the <i>Roman</i> Communion,
who valued himself in a particular manner
upon the Title of the most Catholick King,
offer'd him vast Sums of Money, to engage
him to wed a Protestant.</p>

<p>Shortly after King <i>Charles</i>, by his Mediation,
establish'd a Treaty of Commerce between
the States of <i>Holland</i> and the Crown of
<i>Portugal</i>; after which he sent a considerable
Number of Troops into that Kingdom, commanded
by the Earl of <i>Inchequin</i>: but having
recall'd him, he order'd that the Forces
should stay under the Command of <i>Schomberg</i>;
so that the Count shortly saw himself at the
head of the chosen Forces of three Kingdoms.
Not but that there was a <i>Portuguese</i>
Generalissimo, or at least one who had the
Title, but the Count had all the Authority,
which he made use of to establish an exact
and regular Discipline amongst the <i>Portuguese</i>:
He taught them the Order of marching, encamping,
besieging, and regularly fortifying
a Town; so that all those Places on the
Frontiers of the Kingdom, which were before
naked and defenceless, soon became capable
of making a vigorous Defence.</p>

<p>The Regent Queen, proud of having met
with such a General, carry'd the War vigorously
on, and her Arms were almost every
where crown'd with Success; never were
the <i>Portuguese</i> Forces better disciplin'd, the
People bless'd her Government, the Grandees
continu'd in perfect Submission to it through
Fear and Respect: but though Fortune favour'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
her abroad, she met with domestick
Cares and Troubles, which chang'd the face
of every thing.</p>

<p>Whilst the Regent was taking care to place
the Crown with Surety on her Son's Head,
he, on the other hand, endeavour'd to make
himself unworthy of it, by his irregular Manner
of Living; he was mean-spirited, melancholy,
and cruel, could not bear the Authority
of his Mother, and despis'd the Advices
of his Governours and Ministers; he always
refus'd the Company of the Lords of his
Houshold, and would divert himself with
none but Negroes, Mulattoes, and all the
Scum of the <i>Lisbonite</i> Youth: and spite of
the Care of his Governours, he had got a
little Court compos'd of such like People,
whom he call'd his Bravoes, with whom he
us'd to scour the Streets at Night, and insult
all those who unfortunately fell into his
way.</p>

<p>This Disorder of Mind had been first
caus'd by a Palsy, which had afflicted him
when about four Years of Age, and which had
made fatal Impressions not only on his Limbs,
but also on his Brain. Whilst he was young,
his Faults had been wink'd at by his Tutors,
who thought that so infirm a Child could never
bear the Fatigues of a severe Education,
and hoped that Time would both strengthen
his Body, and sweeten his Temper: but this
Indulgence ruin'd him. 'Tis true, that by
the assistance of Remedies, and help of Time,
his Constitution grew stronger, he could
fence, ride, and bear any Fatigue; but his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Temper never became better. His Passions
encreasing with his Age, they soon prevail'd
over his Reason, which was but weak, and
he gave a loose to Licentiousness and Debauchery.
He would bring common Prostitutes
into the Palace, fetch them himself from
the Stews, and very often spend whole Nights
amongst them there.</p>

<p>The Queen, overwhelm'd with Grief, and
fearing that the Irregularity of her Son
would at once destroy the Labours of her
whole Life, resolv'd several times within herself
to have him confin'd, and make his Brother
reign in his stead; but dreading to excite
a Civil War, which would have favour'd
the <i>Spanish</i> Arms, she dropp'd the bold Design:
sometimes she hoped the King might
yet be reclaim'd, especially if he was depriv'd
of the Company of <i>Conti</i>, a Merchant's
Son, his first Favourite, and Companion of
all his Debaucheries. To this end she had
<i>Conti</i> privately seiz'd, and carry'd on board
a Ship which was bound for <i>Brazil</i>, with
Orders that he should never return to <i>Portugal</i>
on pain of Death.</p>

<p>The King at first seem'd very much griev'd
at the Loss of his Favourite, but comforting
himself by little and little, he was at last pacify'd,
and seem'd very much alter'd for the
better, would hearken to Advice, and paid
the Queen an unusual Respect, who was congratulated
by the Ministry and the whole
Court, upon the extraordinary Success of her
Enterprize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>But this apparent Tranquillity and Alteration
of the King's, was only a Veil to cover
a deep Design, and of which his Mother never
thought him capable; so that this Princess,
who could read in the very Hearts of
the most dissembling Courtiers, was overreach'd
by a half-witted Youth.</p>

<p>The King had complain'd of <i>Conti</i>'s Banishment
to the Count <i>de Castel-Melhor</i>, a <i>Portuguese</i>
Nobleman, of an illustrious Birth,
subtle and insinuating, but fitter to manage
a Court-Intrigue, than a Business of Importance.
The Count thought that a fair Opportunity
offer'd of supplying <i>Conti</i>'s Place in
the King's Favour; wherefore to ingratiate
himself, he deplor'd the Exile's Misfortune,
and promis'd to use his utmost Endeavours
to have him recall'd. He told the Prince at
the same time, that it was in his own power
to remedy this, or any Grievance of the like
nature; that he was of Age, and had been so
a great while; that he might as soon as he
pleased take the Supreme Command upon
himself, then recall <i>Conti</i>, and let him triumph
over the Queen, and all his other Enemies.</p>

<p>The King was pleas'd with this Advice,
and determin'd to follow it; the Count was
his sole Confidant and Favourite: however,
he desir'd the King that their Intimacy
should still be a Secret, that the Queen might
not suspect him: but it could not be long
conceal'd from this Princess, who meeting
him one day in the King's Train, caught
him by the Arm, and staring him in the face
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
with that Majestick Air, which made every
one tremble; "I am inform'd, Count, <i>said
she</i>, that the King is wholly govern'd by
your Counsels; take therefore good care of
him, for if he does any thing to thwart
me, your Life shall answer it."</p>

<p>The Count, without answering, made a
submissive Bow, and follow'd the King, who
call'd him. As soon as he was alone with
him, he gave him an account of what the
Queen had said: "I suppose, <i>continued he</i>,
that I shall shorty share <i>Conti</i>'s Fate, but
yet with Joy should I go to Banishment,
could I at the same time see my King
shake off the Authority of an imperious
Mother, who will let him enjoy the Title,
but never the Power of a Sovereign."</p>

<p>This artful Discourse threw the Prince into
a violent Passion, and he would go immediately
and take the Royal Authority from
the Queen, by taking the Great Seal, which
is the Mark of it; but the Count, who
knew too well what the consequence of this
would be, advis'd him to retire to <i>Alcantra</i>,
and from thence to send Couriers to the Magistrates
of <i>Lisbon</i>, and to all the Governours
of Provinces, to let them know that he was
of Age, and had taken the Government
upon himself.</p>

<p>The King approv'd the Counsel, and
having that Evening disguis'd himself, he left
the Palace, follow'd only by the Count and
a few Friends. That Night they arriv'd at
<i>Alcantra</i>, from whence he sent Orders to the
Secretaries of State, and to the <i>German</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Guard, to come to him; and at the same
time dispatch'd Couriers to every Town of
<i>Portugal</i>, to let them know that he was of
Age, and by consequence the Regency of
the Queen at an end.</p>

<p>Most of the Court set out for <i>Alcantra</i>,
and the Queen saw herself in a manner forsaken;
notwithstanding which, she resolv'd
to lay down her Authority as became her:
wherefore she wrote to the King, to ask him
the reason why he took possession of the
Throne like an Usurper, that had no Right
to it; and added, that if he would return to
<i>Lisbon</i>, she would lay down her Authority
in presence of the Grandees and the Magistrates.
The King accordingly return'd, and
the Queen having summon'd the Grandees,
Magistrates, and others of the Nobility, to
attend her, in presence of the Assembly took
the Seals out of the Great Purse, and putting
them into her Son's Hand, "Here are,
<i>said she</i>, the Seals, which, together with
the Regency, were entrusted to my Care
by the Will of my late Sovereign Lord:
I return them to your Majesty with all the
Authority, which they are the Emblems
of; I heartily pray God that you may
make a good use of them, and that your
Reign may be as prosperous as I can wish
it." The King took the Seals, and gave
them to the first Secretary of State; after
which the Prince, and all the Grandees,
kiss'd his Hand, and acknowledg'd him their
Sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen Dowager had given out, that
she intended in six Months time to retire into
a Convent, but that six Months she would
spend at Court, to see what Measures the
young King would take. But the Favourite
Count, who still dreaded that Princess, who
knew her tow'ring Genius, and was sensible
of the natural Sway which a Mother
has over the Mind of her Son, persuaded the
King to treat her most inhumanly, that by
frequent Affronts he might oblige her to
leave the Court much sooner than she intended.
The Queen, who was of a haughty
Temper, could not bear to be thus us'd,
but immediately threw herself into a Convent;
where, being fully satisfy'd of the Vanities
of human Greatness, she spent the Remainder
of her Time, which was scarce a
Year, in preparing herself for another World,
and died on the eighteenth of <i>February</i>, 1666.
lamented by the whole Nation: for never
was there a Princess of a more extraordinary
Genius, or more amply endow'd with all the
Vertues requisite to either the one or the
other Sex. Whilst on the Throne, she
shew'd a truly great and heroick Soul; when
she quitted it for a religious Life, she seem'd
entirely to have forgotten what Pomp and
Grandeur were, and all her Ambition then
was to deserve Heaven.</p>

<p>The King, who now saw himself fully at
liberty, and no longer fear'd the prudent
Queen's just Reproofs, gave a loose to his
Passions, and indulg'd his pernicious Inclinations.
He would scour the Streets at Night
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
with his Bravoes, and abuse every one he met
with; nor did the Watch fare better than
their Neighbours. Never a Night did he
ramble, but the next Morning tragical Histories
were publish'd, of several who had
been wounded or murder'd in the Streets;
and People fled before him with greater Fear
than they would before a hungry Lion, just
broke loose from his Den.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Castel-Melhor</i> was his first
Minister; he was an intriguing, insinuating
Courtier, but far from being an able Statesman:
haughty in Prosperity, fawning and timorous
in Adversity. In his hands were the
Reins of the Government, the King reserving
no Authority to himself, but that of doing
what mischief he pleas'd unpunish'd;
nor did the Count ever make it his business
to reclaim him, well knowing that the
King's Follies and his Authority were inseparable.</p>

<p>The <i>Spaniards</i> flatter'd themselves with
the Hopes of easily reducing <i>Portugal</i>, whilst
it had such a Monarch as Don <i>Alphonso</i>. To
this end they sent a strong Army against it,
under the Command of Don <i>John</i> of <i>Austria</i>,
natural Son to <i>Philip</i> IV. The King of <i>Portugal</i>
sent <i>Schomberg</i> to oppose him, notwithstanding
the Count <i>de Villa-Flor</i> had the Title of Generalissimo.
And to the Count of <i>Schomberg</i>'s
Courage and Conduct it was that Don <i>Alphonso</i>
ow'd the Preservation of his Crown:
He beat the <i>Spaniards</i> several times, notwithstanding
what <i>Villa-Flor</i> did; who, jealous
of his Glory, endeavour'd all he could to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
cross his Measures, and had effectually done
it, had not <i>Schomberg</i>'s Interest been greater
both at Court and in the Army, which joyfully
obey'd the Commands of their brave
Leader, who always led them to a certain
Victory.</p>

<p><i>Castel-Melhor</i> did all he could to persuade
the People, that this happy Success was owing
to him; though if the Truth had been
search'd into, it would have appear'd that
all he could justly boast of, was his being the
first Man to whom the News was sent. By
these means the Minister's Credit encreas'd,
and he actually enjoy'd the Sovereign Authority.
The King was nothing but a piece of
Clock-work, whose Springs he could wind
up, and put into what Motion he pleas'd.
The Barbarity of his Temper he made use
of, to ruin and destroy all those of whom he
was jealous; amongst these were the greatest
part of the late Queen's Ministry: so that
there was a strange Alteration at Court, all
Places were fill'd with the Count's Creatures;
nor could any one hope for Favour,
but those who took care to please the Favourite.
<i>Melhor</i> went farther than this, for
<i>Conti</i> being recall'd, he got him banish'd
a second time; for no sooner was he landed,
but the King sent him an Express, to
congratulate him upon his safe Arrival, and
<i>Melhor</i>, by the same Express, sent him Orders
not to come near the Court: such a
Sway had this Minister over his Sovereign,
that he durst not contradict his Orders, but
for fear of dipleasing him, was obliged to see
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<i>Conti</i> in private. The Count had notice of it,
and fearing that should their antient Intimacy
be renew'd, there would be no place left for
him in the King's Favour, had him accus'd
of a Design upon the Prince's Life; and tho
there were no Witnesses found, no Proofs, no
Probabilities of his Guilt, yet Sentence of
Banishment was pass'd upon him.</p>

<p>The Count, no longer apprehensive of <i>Conti</i>,
began to consider how he should secure
his Interest at Court, in case of any Accident.
To this end he endeavour'd to ingratiate
himself with Don <i>Pedro</i>, the King's Brother,
but a Prince of a quite different Character:
His Soul was truly great, and his Inclinations
noble; his Actions princely, and his
manner of Living regular: the <i>Portuguese</i> admir'd,
or rather ador'd him, for he had not
his own Vertues only, but his Brother's
Vices also, to set him off.</p>

<p>To this end, <i>Melhor</i> plac'd a Brother of
his in the Prince's Houshold, and bad him
do all he could to insinuate himself into his
Master's Favour, as he had into the King's;
hoping by these means to govern both the
Princes.</p>

<p>Don <i>Pedro</i> us'd him with all the Civility imaginable,
and shew'd him more than common
Respect; but as for giving him any place in
his Favour, or Confidance, he could not; the
whole was taken up. The late Queen having
always look'd upon her younger Son as the
Hopes and Support of her Family, she had
taken care to put about him none but those,
whose Wisdom, Learning, and Integrity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
might entitle them to a share of the Prince's
Love; such were his Governours, and of
such chiefly was his Houshold compos'd.
These had taken care to let the Prince know,
that he need not despair of one day wearing
the Crown of <i>Portugal</i>, for that there was no
great likelihood of his Brother's ever having
any Children; but at the same time they
told him, that there was nothing but <i>Melhor</i>
was capable of doing, to keep him from inheriting
the Crown, since he was well assur'd
that he must never hope for any share in the
Ministry, when Don <i>Pedro</i> should ascend the
Throne.</p>

<p>By degrees these different Views and Interests
divided the Court into two Cabals;
the Count indeed had the greatest Number
on his side, there being more who love to
swim with the Stream, than against it. But
the ablest Statesmen, who plainly saw that so
violent and arbitrary a Government could not
last long, with all the Grandees, and the best
of the Nobility, who would not cringe to
such a Favourite as the King's was, were always
about the Prince, to whom they paid
their Respects as to the Heir apparent.</p>

<p>The Count being sensible that the Hope
of the adverse Faction was founded upon the
Infirmity of the King, determin'd to destroy
it at once, by marrying him; and
by his Advice a Match was propos'd and
concluded between the King and <i>Mary-Elizabeth-Frances</i>
of <i>Savoy</i>, Daughter to <i>Charles</i>
Duke of <i>Nemours</i>, and <i>Elizabeth de Vendome</i>.
<i>Cæsar d'Estrées</i>, a Relation of hers, Bishop
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and Duke of <i>Laon</i>, and known all over <i>Europe</i>
by the Name of the illustrious Cardinal
<i>d'Estrées</i>, conducted her into <i>Portugal</i>, accompany'd
with the Marquiss <i>de Ruvigni</i>, the
<i>French</i> Ambassador, and several other Persons
of Quality.</p>

<p>This Marriage was celebrated with all the
Pomp and Magnificence imaginable. The
whole Court admir'd the young Queen's extraordinary
Beauty, but no one was more
sensibly affected with it than the Prince.
The King was the only Person who seem'd
regardless of her Charms, and who by his
Indifference soon convinc'd the whole Nation,
that he had taken the Name of a Husband,
but was not capable of discharging the
Duty of one.</p>

<p>Count <i>Melhor</i> had at first flatter'd himself
with the Hopes of governing the Queen as
well as the King, but soon found that
she had too great a Spirit for such a
Submission. Enrag'd at this, he resolv'd
to lose no Opportunity of revenging himself,
all publick Business was carefully
hid from her, all her Desires were cross'd;
her Recommendation certainly excluded
any Person from the Place to which she
recommended him. Shortly after, neither
the Expences of her Houshold, nor her own
Pensions were paid, under pretence that the
War and other Necessities of the State had
exhausted the Royal Treasury. And so insolent
was this haughty Minister to every body,
to the Prince himself, but especially to the
Queen, that she has been often seen coming
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
out of the King's Apartment bath'd in
Tears.</p>

<p>Her Beauty, her Merits, her Misfortunes,
and the Complaints of all the Ladies of the
Court, and the Officers of the Queen's
Houshold, whose Salaries were stopp'd,
touch'd the Hearts of all those who had not
an immediate Dependence on the Minister;
and these form'd a third Party at Court,
where nothing now was talk'd of but the
Improbability of the Queen's having any
Children, tho she had not yet been married
a Year.</p>

<p>What encreas'd every one's Suspicion, was
the Report which was spread of a private
Door, which by the King's Order was made
in the Queen's Chamber, and open'd just
against her Bed-side, and of which he himself
kept the Key. The Queen was alarm'd at the
Novelty of the thing, and the Danger to
which she saw her Honour expos'd. And
many concluded, that this was an Artifice of
<i>Melhor</i>'s, who, notwithstanding the Infirmity
of the King, was nevertheless resolv'd that
the Queen should have Children.</p>

<p>The poor unfortunate Princess discover'd
her Apprehensions to her Confessor, with
Orders to impart them to the Prince's.
These two Religious Men advis'd them to
unite their Cabals, and go hand in hand together
in a Matter so much the Concern of
them both. The Count of <i>Schomberg</i> was
easily drawn into this Party, and the Prince
took care to make himself beloved by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Magistrates of the City, and all those who
had any influence over the People.</p>

<p>It would have been a very easy matter to
have push'd the King from out his Throne,
had he not had a Minister to support him,
who was ambitious, could govern the King
as he pleas'd, make him do any thing,
and who would spare no pains to preserve
himself at the head of Affairs; the only
way therefore of compassing their Ends, was
to remove this Man, which was at last
brought about in this manner. One of his
Friends was bribed to tell him, that the
Prince had swore he would sacrifice him, if
he continued any longer at Court. The
Count upon this Information doubled the
Guards, arm'd all the Officers of the Household,
and would have had the King go at
the head of them, and seize the Prince. But
as furious as the King was in his Midnight-Revels
and Debauches, he had not Courage
enough to attempt any thing of this nature,
justly fearing that he should meet with no
small Resistance. Wherefore he only wrote
a Letter to the Prince, to order him to come
to the Palace. He excus'd himself, objecting
that he could not come whilst the Count
was at Court, who had spread so many Stories
to his disadvantage, and endeavour'd all
he could to blast his Reputation; besides
which, the Count was Master of the Palace,
and that therefore he fear'd he could not be
in safety there. Several Letters pass'd between
the King and Prince; the former
offer'd, that <i>Melhor</i> should come, and on his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Knees beg his pardon. But this was not
what the Prince wanted, and he openly refus'd
to come to Court till <i>Melhor</i> was banish'd
from it.</p>

<p>The News of this had put <i>Lisbon</i> into a
strange Confusion, and a Civil War was just
breaking out; but <i>Melhor</i> with grief perceiv'd
that <i>Schomberg</i> favour'd the other Party, and
that the Grandees of the Kingdom had all
unanimously declar'd themselves in favour
of the Prince; who, assisted also by the
Queen's Friends, grew too powerful for him.
Nay, <i>Melhor</i>'s very Relations, and those
whom he had rais'd, forsook him, and told
him, that if he must sink, he should sink alone.
Wherefore disguising himself, he by
Night escaped from the Palace, and retired
to a Monastery seven Leagues from <i>Lisbon</i>;
which he soon after left, to seek a sure Refuge
in the Court of <i>Turin</i>.</p>

<p>Upon this the Prince immediately came to
the Palace, to pay his Devoirs to the King;
every thing fell under his Management, and
he soon dispersed all the late Favourite's
Creatures. The King, destitute of Counsel,
lay at the Prince's mercy, who had a
Design upon, but durst not as yet touch his
Crown, for fear of being thought an Usurper;
but waited with patience till it should
be given him by Lawful Authority, that
is, by a Decree of the States of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>But then it was in the King's power only
to call together this Assembly of the States,
which he was often advis'd to do, there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
being an absolute Necessity of their Meeting,
to remedy the present Grievances of the
Nation.</p>

<p>The King was not so weak, but he
plainly perceiv'd that this Advice was given
him, with a design to transfer the Royalty
from himself to his Brother; wherefore he
long refus'd it, but was at last so press'd to
it both by his Council, and by different Petitions
from several Parts of the Kingdom,
that he call'd them together, and they were
order'd to meet on the first of <i>January</i>,
1688.</p>

<p>The Prince having obtain'd this, which
he look'd upon as a sure step to the Throne,
gave the Queen notice, that it was time for
her now to appear, and play her part. Upon
which she immediately retired into a Convent,
and wrote a Letter to the King, to
tell him, that she thought herself in Conscience
obliged to quit the Palace, since he
was not capable of being her Husband; that
he was very sensible that their Marriage was
never consummated, and that therefore she
begg'd that he would repay her her Portion,
and give her leave to return to her Country,
and amongst her own Relations.</p>

<p>Upon the Receipt of this Letter, the King
in a great Rage flew towards the Convent,
to fetch the Queen back to the Palace
by force; but the Prince, who foresaw the
Effect of her Message, took care to be at the
Convent-Door, with all the Nobility, and
told his Brother this was a Place too sacred
to have any Violence us'd in it, and persuaded,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
or rather forc'd the King to return
to the Palace, who all the way complain'd of
being calumniated, and was for bringing half
the Prostitutes of <i>Lisbon</i> to prove his Virility,
and swore that he would be reveng'd both
on the Queen and the Prince.</p>

<p>But Don <i>Pedro</i> was not in the least frightned
at his Menaces, knowing that the whole
Power of the Kingdom was in his own
hands; and the next Morning (thinking it
unsafe to delay the mighty Work any longer)
order'd the Council to assemble, and follow'd
by the Nobility, the Magistracy, and a whole
Crowd of People, who wanted to see the
Event of this Business, he went into the Palace
to them; and after a short Debate, an
Order was sent by the Prince to arrest the
King, who shortly after this sign'd his own
Abdication.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the Prince would
not take any other Title, but that of Regent;
under which Name the States of the
Kingdom took the Oath of Allegiance to
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Febr. 13.<br />
1668.</i></div>

<p>The next thing he did, was to secure a
Peace with <i>Spain</i>; the King of <i>England</i> made
himself their Mediator, and <i>Spain</i>, by a solemn
Treaty, acknowledg'd the Crown of
<i>Portugal</i> independent of the Crown of
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nov. 22.<br />
1667.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mar. 24.<br />
1668.</i></div>

<p>But one thing was still wanting to compleat
the Regent's Happiness: he loved his
Sister-in-law; who, as soon as she was got
into the Convent, had presented a Petition
to the Chapter of the Cathedral of <i>Lisbon</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to desire them, during the Vacancy of the
Holy See, to declare her Marriage void;
since, notwithstanding fifteen Months Cohabitation
with her Husband, it had not been
consummated. The Chapter, without waiting
for any farther Proof, immediately declar'd
the Marriage void.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>March 2.<br />
1668.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dec. 10.<br />
1668.</i></div>

<p>By these means the Regent saw himself at
liberty to marry his Sister-in-law; however,
he was advis'd, for fear of scandalizing any
one, to get a Dispensation from the See of
<i>Rome</i>. Just at this time the Cardinal <i>de Vendome</i>,
Legate <i>à Latere</i>, was order'd by the
See to put on the Papal Dignity, that he
might assist as Pope at the Christening of the
Dauphin of <i>France</i>; from him was the Dispensation
obtain'd, which Mr. <i>Verjus</i> arriv'd
with in <i>Portugal</i> about the time that the
Chapter pronounced their Sentence. All
which Accidents falling out together, made
some People imagine that they were premeditated.
The Bishop of <i>Targa</i>, Coadjutor
to the Archbishop of Lisbon, married them in
virtue of this Brief, which was afterwards
confirm'd by Pope <i>Innocent</i> IX.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Don <i>Alphonso</i> was banish'd to the Isle of
<i>Tercera</i>, which belongs to the <i>Portuguese</i>.
This something displeas'd the People, who
generally pity the Unfortunate, and who
now cry'd out, that it was enough to rob
him of his Wife and Crown, without driving
him from his Country; but however, no
one dar'd speak to the Regent about it. He
continued in this Exile till the Year 1675,
at which time the Regent recall'd him, being
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
inform'd that there were some discontented
People contriving how to fetch him
from <i>Tercera</i>, and reinstate him in the
Throne. He died not far from <i>Lisbon</i>, 1683,
and at his Death Don <i>Pedro</i> was proclaim'd
King; a Title he would not, during his
Brother's Life, accept, and the only thing
of which he had not depriv'd that unfortunate
Prince.</p>
